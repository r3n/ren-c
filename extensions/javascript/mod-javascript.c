//=//// NOTES /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// * This extension expands the RL_rebXXX() API with new entry points.  It
//   was tried to avoid this--doing everything with helper natives.  This
//   would use things like `reb.UnboxInteger("rebpromise-helper", ...)` and
//   build a pure-JS reb.Promise() on top of that.  Initially this was
//   rejected due reb.UnboxInteger() allocating stack for the va_list calling
//   convention...disrupting the "sneaky exit and reentry" done by the
//   Emterpreter.  Now that Emterpreter is replaced with Asyncify, that's
//   not an issue--but it's still faster to have raw WASM entry points like
//   RL_rebPromise_internal().
//
// * If the code block in the EM_ASM() family of functions contains a comma,
//   then wrap the whole code block inside parentheses ().  See the examples
//   which are cited in %em_asm.h
//
// * Stack overflows were historically checked via a limit calculated at boot
//   time (see notes on Set_Stack_Limit()).  That can't be used in the
//   emscripten build, hence stack overflows currently crash.  This is being
//   tackled by means of the stackless branch (unfinished at time of writing):
//
//   https://forum.rebol.info/t/switching-to-stackless-why-this-why-now/1247
//
// * Note that how many JS function recursions there are is affected by
//   optimization levels like -Os or -Oz.  These avoid inlining, which
//   means more JavaScript/WASM stack calls to do the same amount of work...
//   leading to invisible limit being hit sooner.  We should always compile
//   %c-eval.c with -O2 to try and avoid too many recursions, so see
//   #prefer-O2-optimization in %file-base.r.  Stackless will make this less
//   of an issue.
//

// it until this: https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/pull/8089

// Ren-C has a very aggressive debug build.  Turning on all the debugging
// means a prohibitive experience in emscripten--not just in size and speed of
// the build products, but the compilation can wind up taking a long time--or
// not succeeding at all).
//
// So most of the system is built with NDEBUG, and no debugging is built
// in for the emscripten build.  The hope is that the core is tested elsewhere
// (or if a bug is encountered in the interpreter under emscripten, it will
// be reproduced and can be debugged in a non-JavaScript build).
//
// However, getting some amount of feedback in the console is essential to
// debugging the JavaScript extension itself.  These are some interim hacks
// for doing that until better ideas come along.

//=//// HEAP ADDRESS ABSTRACTION //////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Generally speaking, C exchanges integers with JavaScript.  These integers
// (e.g. the ones that come back from EM_ASM_INT) are typed as `unsigned int`.
// That's unfortunately not a `uintptr_t`...which would be a type that by
// definition can hold any pointer.  But there are cases in the emscripten
// code where this is presumed to be good enough to hold any heap address.
//
// Track the places that make this assumption with `heapaddr_t`, and sanity
// check that we aren't truncating any C pointers in the conversions.
//
// Note heap addresses can be used as ID numbers in JavaScript for mapping
// C entities to JavaScript objects that cannot be referred to directly.
// Tables referring to them must be updated when the related pointer is
// freed, as the pointer may get reused.

//
// We go ahead and use the REBCTX* instead of the raw REBFRM* to act as the
// unique pointer to identify a frame.  That's because if the JavaScript code
// throws and that throw needs to make it to a promise higher up the stack, it
// uses that pointer as an ID in a mapping table to associate the call with
// the JavaScript object it threw.
//
// !!! This aspect is overkill for something that can only happen once on
// the stack at a time.  Review.
//
// !!! Future designs may translate that object into Rebol so it could
// be caught by Rebol, but for now we assume a throw originating from
// JavaScript code may only be caught by JavaScript code.

// All Rebol ACTION!s that claim to be natives have to provide a BODY field
// for source, and an ANY-CONTEXT! that indicates where any API calls will
// be bound while that native is on the stack.  For now, if you're writing
// any JavaScript native it will presume binding in the user context.
//
// (A refinement could be added to control this, e.g. JS-NATIVE/CONTEXT.
// But generally the caller of the API can override with their own binding.)
//
// For the JS-native-specific information, it uses a HANDLE!...but only to
// get the GC hook a handle provides.  When a JavaScript native is GC'd, it
// calls into JavaScript to remove the mapping from integer to function that
// was put in that table at the time of creation (the native_id).

// with any other green-thread scheduling.  It's not currently tested, and is
// here as a placeholder for future work.
