    ; etc. in the user context and thus isn't isolated.  It is run directly by
    ; a DO from the C libRebol prep script, so that it will have the
    ; structures and helpers set up to process API endpoints.  However, the
    ; ability to do this should be offered as a general build system hook
    ; to extensions (also needed by the TCC extension)

    Description: {
        The WASM files produced by Emscripten produce JavaScript functions
        that expect their arguments to be in terms of the SharedArrayBuffer
        HEAP32 that the C code can see.  For common JavaScript types, the
        `cwrap` helper can do most of the work:

        https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/Interacting-with-code.html

        However, libRebol makes extensive use of variadic functions, which
        means it needs to do interact with the `va_list()` convention.
        This is beyond the C standard and each compiler can implement it
        differently.  But it was reverse-engineered from emcc/clang build
        output for a simple variadic function.  Since that's the only
        compiler Emscripten works with, we mimic its method of allocation
        with a custom variant of the cwrap helper.

=== ASYNCIFY_BLACKLIST TOLERANT CWRAP ===

; Emscripten's `cwrap` is based on a version of ccall which does not allow
; syncronous function calls in the Asyncify build while emscripten_sleep() is
; in effect.  However, this is an overly conservative assert when the function
; is on the blacklist and known to not yield:
;
; https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/9412
;
; Until that's resolved, we can't use cwrap()/ccall().  So for the moment
; we copy the code directly from %preamble.js...minus that assert:
;
; https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/incoming/src/preamble.js
;
; Note: In actuality, there's no preprocessor on this file as on preamble.js
; so this has to either keep or drop *all* of the code under `#if` directives,
; (-or- we'd have to do some preprocessing equivalent based on the build
; settings in the config we are doing `make prep` for.)
;
; !!! There may be few enough routines involved that the better answer is to
; dodge `cwrap`/`ccall` altogether and just by-hand wrap the routines.

=== GENERATE ASYNCIFY BLACKLIST FILE ===

; Asyncify has some automatic ability to determine what functions cannot be
; on the stack when a function may yield.  It then does not instrument these
; functions with the additional code allowing it to yield.  However, it makes
; a conservative guess...so it can be helped with additional blacklisted
; functions that one has inside knowledge should *not* be asyncified:
;
; https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/asyncify.html#optimizing
;
; While the list expected by Emscripten is JSON, that doesn't support comments
; so we transform it from Rebol.
;
; <review> ; IN LIGHT OF ASYNCIFY
; Beyond speed, an API marked in the blacklist has the special ability of
; still being run while in the yielding state (a feature added to Emscripten
; due to a Ren-C request):
;
; https://stackoverflow.com/q/51204703/
;
; This means that APIs which are able to be blacklisted can be called directly
; from inside a JS-AWAITER.  That means being able to produce `reb.Text()`
; and other values.  But also critically can include reb.Promise() so that
; the final return value of a JS-AWAITER can be returned with it.
