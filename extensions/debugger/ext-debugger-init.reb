    Title: "Debugger Extension"
    Name: Debugger

    Type: Module
    Options: []  ; !!! If ISOLATE, wouldn't see LIB/PRINT changes, etc.

    Description: {
        The goal of the debugger in Ren-C is to be mostly usermode code, and
        to rely on leveraging exposure of the FRAME! datatype.  One of the
        concepts involved in that is that things like mappings of integers
        to frames is all part of the userspace code's responsibility.

        !!! This is a port to usermode of what was very experimental C code.
        So it is *doubly* experimental.  The primary hope is to show the
        "shape" of the debugger and that the evaluator is exposing the
        information it would need.  Ideally this would be abstracted across
        the hoops one must jump through to implement a single-threaded
        debugger vs. a threaded/interprocess-focused implementation (e.g.
        via a debug://` PORT!)
    }
]


; !!! Putting the console into usermode code and having a customizable "skin"
; (with sandboxing of expressions run on behalf of the skin vs. user
; evaluations) is a pretty complex idea.  Going to having more than one
; skin in effect raises more questions, since the currently in-effect skin
; was assumed to be `system/console/skin`.
;
; So there are many open issues with that.  For right now, what happens is
; that nested console sessions keep track of `system/console/skin` and put
; it back when they are done, so it always represents the current skin.  We
; add some customizations on the base console for the debugger, but these
; will not interact with shortcuts in the non-debugger skin at this time.
