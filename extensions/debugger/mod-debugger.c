// One goal of Ren-C's debugger is to have as much of it possible written in
// usermode Rebol code, and be easy to hack on and automate.
//
// This file contains interactive debugging support for breaking and
// resuming.  The instructions BREAKPOINT and PAUSE are natives which will
// invoke the CONSOLE function to start an interactive session.  During that
// time Rebol functions may continue to be called, though there is a sandbox
// which prevents the code from throwing or causing errors which will
// propagate past the breakpoint.  The only way to resume normal operation
// is with a "resume instruction".
//
// Hence RESUME and QUIT should be the only ways to get out of the breakpoint.
// Note that RESUME/DO provides a loophole, where it's possible to run code
// that performs a THROW or FAIL which is not trapped by the sandbox.
//

//  Do_Breakpoint_Throws: C
//
// A call to Do_Breakpoint_Throws will call the CONSOLE function.  The RESUME
// native cooperates with the CONSOLE by being able to give back a value (or
// give back code to run to produce a value) that the breakpoint returns.
//
// !!! RESUME had another feature, which is to be able to actually unwind and
// simulate a return /AT a function *further up the stack*.  For the moment
// this is not implemented.
