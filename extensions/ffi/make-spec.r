    ; For the FFI to be used, you pretty much require the ability to load a
    ; DLL or shared library.  Currently the `Find_Function()` API is linked
    ; statically (as opposed to making a libRebol call to the LIBRARY! and
    ; giving it a text string, getting back a HANDLE! from which a C function
    ; pointer can be extracted).  Hence headers must be directly included.
    ; But that could be changed.

    ; Vectors are used to model C array structures, and thus for the moment
    ; one must build the vector extension into the executable if you want
    ; FFI support.  This could be decoupled as an option, but the base demos
    ; (like %qsort.r) depend upon it.  Similarly to the issue of static link
    ; of the LIBRARY! extension, it could be possible (if VECTOR! exported it)
    ; to do this via libRebol, asking for a HANDLE! memory pointer for the
    ; vector...but for now we go through the internal includes of the type.
