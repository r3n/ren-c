REBOL [
    Title: "TCC Extension"
    Name: TCC

    Type: Module
    Options: [isolate]
    Version: 1.0.0
    License: {Apache 2.0}

    Description: {
        The COMPILE usermode function is the front-end to the actual COMPILE*
        native, which interfaces directly with the libtcc API.  The front
        end's job is basically to do all the work that *can* be done in Rebol,
        so the amount of low-level C code is minimized.

        Among COMPILE's duties:

        * Transform any Rebol FILE! paths into TEXT! via FILE-TO-LOCAL, so
          that the paths contain the expected backslashes on Windows, etc.

        * For options that can be a list, make sure any missing options are
          turned into an empty block, and single options are turned into a
          single-element block.  This makes fewer cases for the C to handle.

        * If it's necessary to inject any automatic headers (e.g. to add
          {#include "rebol.h"} for accessing the libRebol API) then it does
          that here, instead of making that decision in the C code.

        * Extract embedded header files and library files to the local file
          system.  These allow a Rebol executable that is distributed as a
          single EXE to function as a "standalone" compiler.

          !!! ^-- Planned future feature: See README.md.

        These features could become more imaginative, considering COMPILE as
        a generic "make" service for an embedded TCC.  It could do multiple
        compilation and linking units, allow you to use include files via
        URL!, etc.  For now, it is primarily in service to user natives.
