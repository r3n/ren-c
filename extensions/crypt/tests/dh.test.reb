; Because key exchange involves random numbers, testing is a difficult besides
; testing for whether shared secret computation comes out right.  But any test
; is better than none.


; Byte size primes are a good example to study and have work for instructional
; purposes, for those who are trying to understand.  There are no byte-sized
; prime combinations which seem to pass the security issue described here when
; iterated enough times:

;
; However, the /INSECURE refinement causes DH-GENERATE-KEYPAIR to keep trying
; until it gets a private/public keypair that is deemed "secure" (in as much
; as you can ever get "secure" in 8 bits...so *relative* security!)
