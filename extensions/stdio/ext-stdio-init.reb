; During boot, there shouldn't be any output.  However, it would be annoying
; to have to write different versions of every PRINT-based debug routine out
; there which might be used after boot, just because it might be used before.
;
; We use HIJACK because if we just overwrote LIB/WRITE-STDOUT with the new
; function, it would not affect existing specializations and usages.

; But for now it's the buffer to edit and the position the cursor was in.
