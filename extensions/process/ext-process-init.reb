; The Atronix CALL implementation was asynchronous by default, launching a
; process and returning immediately.  However, use of parameters that would
; feed it input or output could make it /WAIT implicitly.
;
; The long term goal would be to have some kind of call PORT! which could be
; generated, and then spoken to to feed I/O programmatically a bit at a time.
; (Similar to Tcl's EXPECT, for instance.)  In lieu of that design, this goes
; ahead and keeps the asynchronous behavior in a lower level and chooses to
; /WAIT by default.
