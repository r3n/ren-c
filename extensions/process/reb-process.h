// !!! The original implementation of CALL from Atronix had to communicate
// between the CALL native (defined in the core) and the host routine
// Call_Core, which was not designed to operate on Rebol types.
// Hence if the user was passing in a BINARY! to which the data for the
// standard out or standard error was to be saved, it was produced in full
// in a buffer and returned, then appended.  This wastes space when compared
// to just appending to the string or binary itself.  With CALL rethought
// as an extension with access to the internal API, this could be changed...
// though for the moment, a malloc()'d buffer is expanded independently by
// BUF_SIZE_CHUNK and returned to CALL.
//
#define BUF_SIZE_CHUNK 4096
