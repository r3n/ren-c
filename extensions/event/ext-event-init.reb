REBOL [
    Title: "EVENT! Extension"
    Name: Event
    Type: Module
    Options: [isolate]
    Version: 1.0.0
    License: {Apache 2.0}

    Description: {
        This registers the EVENT! data type and makes the "Event Port".  This
        was previously a part of the interpreter core, and so moving it to an
        extension is a "big deal" as it is no longer intrinsic to the
        evaluator or the language--you can do Rebol builds without this.

        (The fact it was called "System Port" hints at how it was thought of
        as essential to the system... Ren-C doesn't see it that way, as using
        a service like PARSE embedded in another language may have no need
        for such things).

        Although it uses generic services, every attempt has been made to
        stick to the principles of the original event system--including that
        EVENT! can fit in one cell.
