; Ren-C tries to bring more method to the madness of Rebol2/R3-Alpha's
; attempt to standardize the internal string format for the language to a
; single codepoint (line feed) to represent newlines.
;
; The basis of this method is to allow carriage returns in strings at
; a mechanical level, but to put in various speed bumps on the edges
; that increasingly prohibit them from entering the system.  Rather than
; try and do "magic", it coaxes users into the world of LF-only files
; (even on Windows)... and for cases where that is not possible it uses
; errors that guide the user to become involved on any needed filtering
; or mutation explicitly at the source level:
