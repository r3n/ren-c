; TRANSCODE is an operation which exposes the scanner, and is the basis of LOAD
; It lets you take in UTF-8 text and gives back a BLOCK! of data
;
; The interface is historically controversial for its complexity:
; https://github.com/rebol/rebol-issues/issues/1916
;
; Ren-C attempts to make it easier.  Plain TRANSCODE with no options will simply
; load a string or binary of UTF-8 in its entirety as the sole return result.
; The multiple-return-awareness kicks it into a more progressive mode, so that
; it returns partial results and can actually give a position of an error.
;
; However, the /RELAX option in Ren-C for error recovery is limited to top-level
; scanning only--as if there were any depth (such as inside a BLOCK! or GROUP!)
; then recovery wouldn't be meaningfully possible.  The hope is to transition
; a recovery-based scan into being done via PARSE or similar, so that a concept
; of resumable state in a parsing heirarchy could be implemented for both.

; Default is to scan a whole block's worth of values
([1 [2] <3>] = transcode "1 [2] <3>")

; When asking for a block's worth of values, an empty string gives empty block
