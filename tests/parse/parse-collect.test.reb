; COLLECT and KEEP keywords in PARSE
;
; Non-keyword COLLECT has issues with binding, but also does not have the
; necessary hook to be able to "backtrack" and remove kept material when a
; match rule containing keeps ultimately fails.  These keywords were initially
; introduced in Red, without backtracking...and affecting the return result.
; In Ren-C, backtracking is implemented, and also it is used to set variables
; (like a SET or COPY) instead of affecting the return result.
