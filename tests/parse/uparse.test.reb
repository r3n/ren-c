; UPARSE for (U)sermode PARSE is a new architecture for PARSE based on the
; concept of parser combinators.  The goal is to put together a more coherent
; and modular design in usermode, which can then be extended or altered by
; using a different set of combinators.  Those combinators can be chosen for
; new features, or just to get compatibility with Rebol2/R3-Alpha/Red parse.


; Unless they are "invisible" (like ELIDE), rules return values.  If the
; rule's purpose is not explicitly to generate new series content (like a
; COLLECT) then it tries to return something very cheap...e.g. a value it
; has on hand, like the rule or the match.  This can actually be useful.
