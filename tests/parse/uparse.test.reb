; UPARSE for (U)sermode PARSE is a new architecture for PARSE based on the
; concept of parser combinators.  The goal is to put together a more coherent
; and modular design in usermode, which can then be extended or altered by
; using a different set of combinators.  Those combinators can be chosen for
; new features, or just to get compatibility with Rebol2/R3-Alpha/Red parse.

; SYM-XXX! are value-bearing rules that do not advance the input and get their
; argument literally.  They succeed unless their result is null (if you want
; success in that case with a null result, combine with OPT rule).
