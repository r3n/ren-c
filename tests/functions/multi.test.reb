; MULTIPLE RETURNS TESTS
;
; Multiple returns in Ren-C are done in a way very much in like historical
; Rebol, where WORD! or PATH! gets passed in to a routine which is the
; variable that is then set by the code.
;
; The difference is that it offers the ability to specifically label such
; refinements as outputs, and if this is done then it will participate
; in the evaluator with the SET-BLOCK! construct, which will do an ordered
; injection of parameters from the left-hand side.  It takes care of
; pre-composing any PATH!s with GROUP!s in them, as well as voiding the
; variables.
;
; This results in functions that can be used in the traditional way or
; that can take advantage of the shorthand.
