; MATCH started out as a userspace function, but gained frequent usage...and
; also has an interesting variadic feature that is not (yet) available to
; userspace VARARGS!.  This enables it to intercept the first argument of a
; filter function, that is invoked.

; !!! MATCH is a tricky action that quotes its first argument, -but- if it
; is a word that calls an action, it builds a frame and invokes that action.
; It's taking on some of the responsibility of the evaluator, and is hence
; experimental and problematic.  Currently we error on quoted WORD!s, until
; such time as the feature is thought out more to know exactly what it
; should do...as it wouldn't see the quote if it were thought of as eval'ing.

; Quoting levels are taken into account with the rule, and the number of

; !!! REVIEW: this is likely not the best idea, should probably be TUPLE!
