; Typically SET and GET evaluate GROUP!s in paths, vs. treat them "as-is".
; But various circumstances like using GROUP! as map keys warrant it.  It's
; also used to avoid double-evaluations in things like DEFAULT (so it can
; COMPOSE a SET-PATH! once, then use GET/HARD to see if it has a value and
; SET/HARD to assign it if needed.)
