; GOB! is a compressed form of object which was part of R3-Alpha to serve
; purposes something like browser DOM nodes.  They automatically manage parent
; and child linkages.  They have a fixed set of fields (including those related
; to coordinates, styles, and effects) but one of those fields provides for
; storing arbitrary data.
;
; Because R3-Alpha's GUI was never finalized, GOB!s had limited use in the
; core.  Hence they were not well-tested.  Ren-C has kept the type around,
; while moving its implementation out of the core...so it is an example of how
; one might define a new datatype in an extension.

;
; Proposals for a more generic NODE! type have been put forth, which would
; make more sense than having so many flags hardcoded for GUI purposes:
