; Note: NULL is not technically a datatype.
;
; It is a transitional state that can be held by variables, but it cannot
; appear in BLOCK!s etc.
;
; While it might be thought of as "variables can hold NULL", it's better
; to say that "NULL is a transitional result used in the evaluator that
; is used by GET to convey a variable is *not set*".  This is a small point
; of distinction, but it helps understand NULL better.

; Early designs for NULL did not let you get or set them from plain WORD!
; Responsibility for kind of "ornery-ness" this shifted to VOID!, as NULL
; took on increasing roles as the "true NONE!" and became the value for
; unused refinements.

; NULL has no visual representation, so FORM errors on it
; Users are expected to triage the NULL to vaporize, error, or find some
; way to represent it "out of band" in their target medium.

; MOLD was reviewed and deemed to be better without this protection than with.

; There are two "isotopes" of NULL (NULL-1 and NULL-2).
; Both answer to being NULL?  A variable assigned with NULL-2 will decay
; to a regular NULL when accessed via a WORD!/GET-WORD!/etc.
;
; The specific role of NULL-2 is to be reactive with THEN and not ELSE, so
; that branches may be purposefully NULL.
