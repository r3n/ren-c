; `%%` was added as a WORD! to serve as a quoting-based MAKE FILE! operator.
;
; Single % is not a good idea to have as a WORD!, because `%/foo` would be
; ambiguous as a PATH! vs. FILE!.  Sacrificing %% as a shorthand for %"%"
; and giving it to WORD! is worth it.  How many other forms would be worth
; it is up in the air, so only %% is legal for now.
