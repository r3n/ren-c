; The inability to have synchronous effects on the GUI while Rebol's WASM

; manipulations with a synchronous-seeming effect (for implementing things
; like PRINT or INPUT):

; comes at a cost of not inlining, which winds up meaning more than just
; slower in the browser: the intrinsic limit of how many JS/WASM functions it
; lets be on the stack is hit sooner.  We can do per-file optimization choices
; so the #prefer-O2-optimization flag is set on the %c-eval.c file, which
