# that we want to see in the Travis log (especially helpful for failures
# only happening in the Travis builds that aren't reproducing locally)

# *something*, and it can't be used on cross-compilations (e.g. a Windows
# executable won't run on Linux).  Running the full test suite would be a
# bit much, and developers are expected to have already done that.  But
# doing an HTTPS read exercises a fair amount of code.
