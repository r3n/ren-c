# Fetch a Rebol binary to use as the "r3-make".
# Its job is to process C and Rebol sources to automatically generate some
# header files and embedded Rebol code bundles used in bootstrap, as well as
# to generate makefiles.
#
# !!! Originally, the Rebol that was fetched was the last r3-alpha that was
# published on rebol.com, to ensure that it could still be used for bootstrap.
# Conversion of the build in mid-2017 to using %rebmake.r meant that only a
# semi-recent Ren-C could be used to run the build prep steps.  There will not
# be an attempt to go back to building with R3-Alpha, though a more purposeful
# stable build should be picked at some point to replace the ad-hoc choice
# which wound up in the make dir.  The shim which is required to upgrade that
# older Ren-C is now rather "thick", and slows the build down significantly.
#

export PREBUILT="$(pwd)/prebuilt"  # see README.md in %prebuilt/ directory

# If we do two builds, we use the bootstrap executable for the first and the
# resulting Rebol from that build to do the second.  To keep from making
# mistakes and accidentally using the wrong r3-make, the executables are
# named `r3-one` and `r3-two`.  (If we only do one build, then r3-one will
# just get renamed to r3-two.)
