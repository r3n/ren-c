; Set up ASSERT as having a user-mode implementation matching VERIFY.
; This helps show people a pattern for implementing their own assert.
;
; !!! If a debug mode were offered, you'd want to be able to put back ASSERT
; in such a way as to cost basically nothing.
;
; !!! Note there is a layering problem, in that if people make a habit of
; hijacking ASSERT, and it's used in lower layer implementations, it could
; recurse.  e.g. if file I/O writing used ASSERT, and you added a logging
; feature via HIJACK that wrote to a file.  Implications of being able to
; override a system-wide assert in this way should be examined, and perhaps
; copies of the function made at layer boundaries.
