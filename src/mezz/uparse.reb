    Title: {UPARSE: Usermode Implementation of PARSE in Ren-C}
    License: {LGPL 3.0}

    Description: {
        Rebol's PARSE is a tool for performing RegEx-style tasks using an
        English-like dialect.  It permits breaking down complex expressions
        into named subrules, and has a very freeform model for escaping into
        and back out of imperative code:

        http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore-15.html
        http://www.codeconscious.com/rebol/parse-tutorial.html
        https://www.red-lang.org/2013/11/041-introducing-parse.html

        The implementation of PARSE engines has traditionally been as
        optimized systems-level code (e.g. C or Red/System), built into the
        interpreter.  This does not offer flexibility to make any minor or
        major changes to the dialect that a user might imagine.

        This script attempts to make PARSE more "hackable", by factoring the
        implementation out so that each keyword or data behavior is handled
        by an individual `parser` function.  The parameters to this function
        are stylized so that the parse engine can compose these smaller
        parsers together as part of larger processing operations.  This
        approach is typically called "Parser Combinators":

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator

        While this overlaps with typical parser combinators, Rebol's design
        affords it a unique spin.  By building the backbone of the dialect as
        a BLOCK!, there's no SEQUENCE or ALTERNATIVE combinators.  Instead,
        blocks make sequencing implicit just by steps being ordered after one
        another.  The alternates are managed by means of `|` markers, which
        are detected by the implementation of the block combinator--and `|` is
        not a combinator in its own right.  With novel operators and convenient
        ways of switching into imperative processing, it gets a unique and
        literate feel with a relatively clean appearance.

        By making the combinator list passed to UPARSE as a MAP!, is possible
        to easily create overrides or variations of the dialect.  (For
        instance, a version that is compatible with older Rebols.)  But the
        goal is to facilitate even more ambitious features.
    }

    Notes: {
        * This implementation will be *extremely* slow for the foreseeable
          future.  But since it is built on usermode facilities, any
          optimizations that are applied to it will bring systemic benefits.
          Ultimately the goal is to merge this architecture in with the
          "messier" C code...hopefully preserving enough of the hackability
          while leveraging low-level optimizations where possible.

; All combinators receive the INPUT to be processed.  They are also given an
; object representing the STATE of the parse (currently that is just the
; FRAME! of the main UPARSE call which triggered the operation, so any of the
; locals or parameters to that can be accessed, e.g. the list of /COMBINATORS)
;
; The goal of a combinator is to decide whether to match (by returning a
; new position in the series) or fail to match (by returning a NULL)
;
; Additional parameters to a combinator are fulfilled by the parse engine by
; looking at the ensuing rules in the rule block.
;
; One of the parameter types that can be given to these functions are another
; parser, to combine them (hence "parser combinator").  So you can take a
; combinator like OPT and parameterize it with SOME which is parameterized
; with "A", to get the parser `opt some "a"`.
;
; But if a parameter to a combinator is marked as quoted, then that will take
; a value from the callsite literally.
;
; A special COMBINATOR generator is used.  This saves on repetition of
; parameters and also lets the engine get its hooks into the execution of
; parsers...for instance to diagnose the furthest point the parsing reached.

    ;
    ;     ahead text! into [some "a"]  ; arity-1 form
    ;     =>
    ;     into text! [some "a"]  ; arity-2 form
    ;
    ; The belief being that wanting to test the type you were going "INTO" was
    ; needed more often than not, and that at worst it would incentivize adding
    ; the type as a comment.  Neither R3-Alpha nor Red adopted this proposal
    ; (but Topaz did).
    ;
    ; UPARSE reframes this not to take just a datatype, but a "value-bearing
    ; rule".  This means you can use it with generated data that is not
    ; strictly resident in the series:
    ;
    ;     uparse "((aaaa)))" [into [between some "(" some ")"] [some "a"]]
    ;
    ; Because any value-bearing rule can be used, GROUP! rules are also legal,
    ; which lets you break the rules up for legibility (and avoids interpreting
    ; arrays as rules themselves)
    ;
    ;     uparse [| | any any any | | |] [

    === ACTION! COMBINATOR ===

    ; The ACTION! combinator is a new idea of letting you call a normal
    ; function with parsers fulfilling the arguments.  At the Montreal
    ; conference Carl said he was skeptical of PARSE getting any harder to read
    ; than it was already, so the isolation of DO code to GROUP!s seemed like
    ; it was a good idea, but maybe allowing calling zero-arity functions.
    ;
    ; With Ren-C it's easier to try these ideas out.  So the concept is that
    ; you can make a PATH! that ends in / and that will be run as a normal
    ; ACTION!, but whose arguments are fulfilled via PARSE.

    action! combinator [
        {Run an ordinary ACTION! with parse rule products as its arguments}
        return: "The return value of the action"

        ; and pass them in a refinement we know about.  This is the beginning
        ; of a possible generic mechanism for variadic combinators, but it's
        ; tricky because the variadic step is before this function actually

    === BLOCK! COMBINATOR ===

    ; Handling of BLOCK! is the central combinator.  The contents are processed
    ; as a set of alternatives separated by `|`, with a higher-level sequence
    ; operation indicated by `||`.  The bars are treated specially; e.g. | is
    ; not an "OR combinator" due to semantics, because if arguments to all the
    ; steps were captured in one giant ACTION! that would mean changes to
    ; variables by a GROUP! would not be percieved by later steps...since once
    ; a rule like SOME captures a variable it won't see changes:
    ;
    ; https://forum.rebol.info/t/when-should-parse-notice-changes/1528
    ;
    ; (There is also a performance benefit, since if | was a combinator then
    ; a sequence of 100 alternates would have to build a very large OR
    ; function...rather than being able to build a small function for each
    ; step that could short circuit before the others were needed.)

=== ENTRY POINTS: UPARSE*, UPARSE, MATCH-UPARSE, and UPARSE? ===

; The historical Redbol PARSE was focused on returning a LOGIC! so that you
; could write `if parse data rules [...]` and easily react to finding out if
; the rules matched the input to completion.
;
; While this bias stuck with UPARSE in the beginning, the deeper power of
; returning the evaluated result made it hugely desirable as the main form
; that owns the word "PARSE".  A version that does not check to completion
; is fundamentally the most powerful, since it can just make HERE the last
; result...and then check that the result is at the tail.  Other variables
; can be set as well.
;
; So this formulates everything on top of a UPARSE* that returns the sythesized
; result

    === OLD STYLE SET AND COPY COMBINATORS ===

    ; Historical Rebol's PARSE had SET and COPY keywords which would take
    ; a WORD! as their first argument, and then a rule.  This was done because
    ; the SET-WORD! was taken for capturing the parse position into a
    ; variable.  That idea was first overturned by a JavaScript implementation
    ; of Rebol called Topaz, using SET-WORD! for generic captures of data
    ; out of the parse input:
    ;
    ; https://github.com/giesse/red-topaz-parse
    ;
    ; Ren-C goes along with this change, including that the position is
    ; captured by `pos: here` instead of simply by `pos:`.  However, the
    ; concept of how combinators can produce a result to be captured is
    ; rethought.

    'copy combinator [
        {(REDBOL) Copy input series elements into a SET-WORD! or WORD!}
        return: "Redbol rules don't return results"
            [<opt> bad-word!]
        'target [word! set-word!]
        parser [action!]
    ][
        if else? ([# (remainder)]: ^ parser input) [
            return null
        ]
        set target copy/part input get remainder
        return ~copy~
    ]

    'set combinator [
        {(REDBOL) Take single input element into a SET-WORD! or WORD!}
        return: "Redbol rules don't return results"
            [<opt> bad-word!]

            set target input.1  ; one unit ahead otherwise
        ]
        return ~set~
    ]

    === OLD STYLE SET-WORD! AND GET-WORD! BEHAVIOR ===

    ; This is the handling for sets and gets that are standalone...e.g. not
    ; otherwise quoted as arguments to combinators (like COPY X: SOME "A").
    ; These implement the historical behavior of saving the parse position
    ; into the variable or restoring it.

        return: "Redbol rules don't return results"

        return ~mark~
    ]

            [<opt> bad-word!]

        ]
        set remainder get value
        return ~seek~
    ]

    === OLD-STYLE INSERT AND CHANGE (TBD) ===

    ; !!! If you are going to make a parser combinator that can distinguish
    ; between:
    ;
    ;     parse ... [insert ...]
    ;     parse ... [insert only ...]
    ;
    ; The concept of skippable quoted WORD! arguments would mean that "..."
    ; couldn't start with a WORD!, in the current framing of <skip>-pable
    ; arguments.  You'd have to write a fully variadic combinator.  Or you
    ; would make the rule that the ... had to be a GROUP! or a BLOCK!!, not
    ; just a WORD!.
    ;
    ; At time of writing, variadic combinators don't exist, and this isn't
    ; a sufficient priority to make them for.  Review later.

    ; In Ren-C, the FAIL word is taken to generally relate to raising errors.
    ; PARSE was using it to mean a forced mismatch.
    ;
    ; Ren-C rethinks this so that logic #[false] is used to indicate a match
    ; has failed, and to roll over to the next alternate (if any).  By making
    ; the logic #[true] mean "keep parsing", this allows evaluated expressions
    ; that are substituted into the parse stream via GET-GROUP! to control
    ; whether parsing continues or not.
