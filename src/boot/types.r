    Purpose: {
        This table is used to make C defines and intialization tables.

        !!! REVIEW IMPACT ON %sys-ordered.h ANY TIME YOU CHANGE THE ORDER !!!

        name        - name of datatype (generates words)
        description - short statement of type's purpose (used by HELP)
        class       - how "generic" actions are dispatched (T_type)
        path        - it supports various path forms
        make        - it can be made with #[datatype] method
        mold        - code implementing both MOLD and FORM (hook gets a flag)
        typesets    - what typesets the type belongs to

        What is in the table can be `+` to mean the method exists and has the
        same name as the type (e.g. MF_Blank() if type is BLANK!)

        If it is `*` then the method uses a common dispatcher for the type,
        so (e.g. PD_Array()) even if the type is BLOCK!)

        If it is `?` then the method is loaded dynamically by an extension,
        and unavailable otherwise and uses e.g. T_Unhooked()

        If it is `-` then it is not available at all, and will substitute with
        an implementation that fails, e.g. CT_Fail()

        If it is 0 then it really should not happen, ever--so just null is
        used to generate an exception (for now).

        Note that if there is `somename` in the class column, that means you
        will find the ACTION! dispatch for that type in `REBTYPE(Somename)`.

; REB_0_END is an array terminator, and not a "type".  It has the 0 as part
; of the name to indicate its zero-ness and C falsey-ness is intrinsic to the
; design--huge parts of the system would not work if it were not zero.

; REB_NULLED takes value 1, but it being 1 is less intrinsic.  It is also not

; of their cell instances to point to their specific datatype.
;
; Exceptions may be permitted.  As an example, EVENT! is implemented in an
; extension (because not all builds need it).  But it reserves a type byte
; and fills in its entry in this table when it is loaded (hence `?`)
