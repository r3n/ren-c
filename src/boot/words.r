    Purpose: {
        These words are used internally by Rebol, and are canonized with small
        integer SYM_XXX constants.  These constants can then be quickly used
        in switch() statements.

; The PICK action was killed in favor of a native that uses the same logic
; as path processing.  Code still remains for processing PICK, and ports or
; other mechanics may wind up using it...or path dispatch itself may be
; rewritten to use the PICK* action (but that would require significiant
; change for setting and getting paths)
;
; Similar story for POKE, which uses the same logic as PICK to find the
; location to write the value.

; that all keys have unique symbols.
;
; To get the feature for today, we use some dummy symbols.  They cannot be
; used alongside the actual names `dummy1`, `dummy2`, etc...but rather
; than pick a more esoteric name then `map-each [_ dummy1] ...` is just an
; error.  Using simple names makes the frame more legible.

; !!! The best implementation concept for LET would be a runtime concept
; where only those instances of LET in an evaluation stream could somehow add
; dynamically to a running context, while inert ones would not.  e.g.
; code like `data: [let x:]` would not create memory for an x variable unless
; you actually `do data`.  But as an interim step before the "virtual binding"
; needed for that exists, LET is searched for as a keyword by FUNC at
; function creation time, much like SET-WORD!s were looked for before.

; There was a special case in R3-Alpha for REBNATIVE(exclude) which wasn't an

; use symbols as identity, this formalizes the hack by adding exclude.
