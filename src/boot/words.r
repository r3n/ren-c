        These words are used internally by Rebol, and are canonized with small
        integer SYM_XXX constants.  These constants can then be quickly used
        in switch() statements.

; === NAMED BAD WORDS ===
; A new Ren-C feature is that voids are interned like WORD!, so they can be
; more communicative.  These are standard symbols passed to Init_Curse_Word().
;
void
stale  ; for non-/VOID DO, e.g. `(1 + 2 do [comment "hi"])` is ~stale~
unset
; null  ; already added as a symbol from type table
falsey
errored  ; when rebRescue() has no handler and evaluates to non-fail ERROR!
trash  ; only release build uses (debug build uses null as label to assert)
rootvar  ; used as placeholder in rootvar cells


; ...note that the words for types are created programmatically before
; this list is applied, so you only see typesets in this file.

; The PICK action was killed in favor of a native that uses the same logic
; as path processing.  Code still remains for processing PICK, and ports or
; other mechanics may wind up using it...or path dispatch itself may be
; rewritten to use the PICK* action (but that would require significiant
; change for setting and getting paths)
;
; Similar story for POKE, which uses the same logic as PICK to find the
; location to write the value.

; that all keys have unique symbols.
;
; To get the feature for today, we use some dummy symbols.  They cannot be
; used alongside the actual names `dummy1`, `dummy2`, etc...but rather
; than pick a more esoteric name then `map-each [_ dummy1] ...` is just an
; error.  Using simple names makes the frame more legible.
