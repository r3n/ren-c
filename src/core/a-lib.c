// This is the "external" API, and %rebol.h contains its exported
// definitions.  That file (and %make-reb-lib.r which generates it) contains
// comments and notes which will help understand it.
//
// What characterizes the external API is that it is not necessary to #include
// the extensive definitions of `struct REBSER` or the APIs for dealing with
// all the internal details (e.g. PUSH_GC_GUARD(), which are easy to get
// wrong).  Not only does this simplify the interface, but it also means that
// the C code using the library isn't competing as much for definitions in
// the global namespace.
//
// Also, due to the nature of REBNOD (see %sys-node.h), it's possible to feed
// the scanner with a list of pointers that may be to UTF-8 strings or to
// Rebol values.  The behavior is to "splice" in the values at the point in
// the scan that they occur, e.g.
//
//     REBVAL *item1 = ...;
//     REBVAL *item2 = ...;
//     REBVAL *item3 = ...;
//
//     REBVAL *result = rebValue(
//         "if not", item1, "[\n",
//             item2, "| print {Close brace separate from content}\n",
//         "] else [\n",
//             item3, "| print {Close brace with content}]\n",
//         rebEND  // see note, optional in C99 and C++11
//     );
//
// (Note: rebEND is needed by the variadic processing, but C99-based macros or
// other language bindings can inject it automatically...only C89 has no way
// to work around it.)
//
// While the approach is flexible, any token must appear fully inside its
// UTF-8 string component.  So you can't--for instance--divide a scan up like
// ("{abc", "def", "ghi}") and get the TEXT! {abcdefghi}.  On that note,
// ("a", "/", "b") produces `a / b` and not the PATH! `a/b`.
//
//==//// NOTES ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Each exported routine here has a name RL_rebXxxYyy.  This is a name by
// which it can be called internally from the codebase like any other function
// that is part of the core.  However, macros for calling it from the core
// are given as `#define rebXxxYyy RL_rebXxxYyy`.  This is a little bit nicer
// and consistent with the way it looks when an external client calls the
// functions.
//
// Then extension clients use macros which have you call the functions through
// a struct-based "interface" (similar to the way that interfaces work in
// something like COM).  Here the macros merely pick the API functions through
// a table, e.g. `#define rebXxxYyy interface_struct->rebXxxYyy`.  This means
// paying a slight performance penalty to dereference that API per call, but
// it keeps API clients from depending on the conventional C linker...so that
// DLLs can be "linked" against a Rebol EXE.
//
// (It is not generically possible to export symbols from an executable, and
// just in general there's no cross-platform assurances about how linking
// works, so this provides the most flexibility.)
//

// would not have to remember to do it.  That made the header file look
// longer, and added function call overhead where it might not be needed.
// Given that the number of APIs is being kept somewhat limited, the macro
// is just included manually.
//
// !!! Review how much checking one wants to do when calling API routines,
// and what the balance should be of debug vs. release.  Right now, this helps
// in particular notice if the core tries to use an API function before the
// proper moment in the boot.

//=//// SERIES-BACKED ALLOCATORS //////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// These are replacements for malloc(), realloc(), and free() which use a
// byte-sized REBSER as the backing store for the data.
//
// One benefit of using a series is that it offers more options for automatic
// memory management (such as being freed in case of a fail(), vs. leaked as
// a malloc() would, or perhaps being GC'd when a particular FRAME! ends).
//
// It also has the benefit of helping interface with client code that has
// been stylized to use malloc()-ish hooks to produce data, when the eventual
// target of that data is a Rebol series.  It does this without exposing
// REBSER* internals to the external API, by allowing one to "rebRepossess()"
// the underlying series as a BINARY! REBVAL*.
//


//
//  rebMalloc: RL_API
//
// * Unlike plain malloc(), this will fail() instead of return null if an
//   allocation cannot be fulfilled.
//
// * Like plain malloc(), if size is zero, the implementation just has to
//   return something that free() will take.  A backing series is added in
//   this case vs. returning null, in order to avoid null handling in other
//   routines (e.g. rebRepossess() or handle lifetime control functions).
//
// * Because of the above points, null is *never* returned.
//
// * In order to make it possible to rebRepossess() the memory as a BINARY!
//   that is then safe to alias as text, it always has an extra 0 byte at
//   the end of the data area.
//
// * It tries to be like malloc() by giving back a pointer "suitably aligned
//   for the size of any fundamental type".  See notes on ALIGN_SIZE.
//
// !!! rebAlignedMalloc() could exist to take an alignment, which could save
// on wasted bytes when ALIGN_SIZE > sizeof(REBSER*)...or work with "weird"
// large fundamental types that need more alignment than ALIGN_SIZE.

// https://stackoverflow.com/a/9575348
//

//
// If the passed in size is less than the size with which the series was

//
// Note that all rebRepossess()'d data will be terminated by an 0x00 byte
// after the end of its capacity.
//
// !!! All bytes in the allocation are expected to be initialized by this
// point, as failure to do so will mean reads crash the interpreter.  See
// remarks in rebMalloc() about the issue, and possibly doing zero fills.
//
// !!! It might seem tempting to use (BIN_LEN(s) - ALIGN_SIZE).  However,
// some routines make allocations bigger than they ultimately need and do not
// realloc() before converting the memory to a series...rebInflate() and
// rebDeflate() do this.  So a version passing the size will be necessary,
// and since C does not have the size exposed in malloc() and you track it

//=//// VALUE CONSTRUCTORS ////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// These routines are for constructing Rebol values from C primitive types.
// The general philosophy is that this stay limited.  Hence there is no
// constructor for making DATE! directly (one is expected to use MAKE DATE!
// and pass in parts that were constructed from integers.)  This also avoids
// creation of otherwise useless C structs, while the Rebol function designs
// are needed to create the values from the interpreter itself.
//
// * There's no function for returning a null pointer, because C's notion of
//   (void*)0 is used.  But note that the C standard permits NULL defined as
//   simply 0.  This breaks use in variadics, so it is advised to use C++'s
//   nullptr, or do `#define nullptr (void*)0
//
// * Routines with full written out names like `rebInteger()` return API
//   handles which must be rebRelease()'d.  Shorter versions like rebI() don't
//   return REBVAL* but are designed for transient use when evaluating, e.g.
//   `rebValue("print [", rebI(count), "]");` does not need to rebRelease()
//   the resulting variable because the evaluator frees it after use.

//=//// EVALUATIVE EXTRACTORS /////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// The libRebol API evaluative routines are all variadic, and call the
// evaluator on multiple pointers.  Each pointer may be:
//
// - a REBVAL*
// - a UTF-8 string to be scanned as one or more values in the sequence
// - a REBSER* that represents an "API instruction"
//
// There isn't a separate concept of routines that perform evaluations and
// ones that extract C fundamental types out of Rebol values.  Hence you
// don't have to say:
//
//      REBVAL *value = rebValue("1 +", some_rebol_integer);
//      int sum = rebUnboxInteger(value);
//      rebRelease(value);
//
// You can just write:
//
//      int sum = rebUnboxInteger("1 +", some_rebol_integer);
//
// The default evaluators splice Rebol values "as-is" into the feed.  This
// means that any evaluator active types (like WORD!, ACTION!, GROUP!...)
// will run.  This can be mitigated with rebQ, but to make it easier for
// some cases variants like `rebValueQ()` and `rebUnboxIntegerQ()` are provided
// which default to splicing with quotes.
//
// (see `#define FLAG_QUOTING_BYTE` for why splice quoting is not the default)

//=//// API "INSTRUCTIONS" ////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// The evaluator API takes further advantage of Detect_Rebol_Pointer() when
// processing variadic arguments to do things more efficiently.
//
// All instructions must be handed *directly* to an evaluator feed.  That
// feed is what guarantees that if a GC occurs that the variadic will be
// spooled forward and their contents guarded.
//
// NOTE THIS IS NOT LEGAL:
//
//     void *instruction = rebQ("stuff");  // not passed direct to evaluator
//     rebElide("print {Hi!}");  // a RECYCLE could be triggered here
//     rebValue(..., instruction, ...);  // the instruction may be corrupt now!
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//


// The rebQ instruction is designed to work so that `rebValue(rebQ(...))` would
// be the same as rebValueQ(...).  Hence it doesn't mean "quote", it means
// "quote any value splices in this section".  And if you turned around and
// said `rebValue(rebQ(rebU(...)))` that should undo your effect.  The two
// operations share a mostly common implementation.
//
// Note that `rebValue("print {One}", rebQ("print {Two}", ...), ...)` should not
// execute rebQ()'s code right when C runs it.  If it did, then `Two` would
// print before `One`.  It has to give back something that provides more than
// one value when the feed visits it.
//
// So what these operations produce is an array.  If it quotes a single value
// then it will just be a singular array (sizeof(REBSER)).  This array is not
// managed by the GC directly--which means it's cheap to allocate and then
// free as the feed passes it by.  which is one of the reasons that a GC has to
// force reification of outstanding variadic feeds)
//
// We lie and say the array is NODE_FLAG_MANAGED when we create it so it
// won't get manuals tracked.  Then clear the managed flag.  If the GC kicks
// in it will spool the va_list() to the end first and take care of it.  If
// it does not kick in, then the array will just be freed as it's passed.
//
// !!! It may be possible to create variations of this which are done in a
// way that would allow arbitrary spans, `rebU("[, value1), value2, "]"`.
// But those variants would have to be more sophisticated than this.
