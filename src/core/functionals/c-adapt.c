// The ADAPT operation is an efficient way to create a variation of a function
// that does some amount of pre-processing (which can include modifying the
// arguments), before the original implementation is called:
//
//     >> ap1: adapt :append [if integer? :value [value: value + 716]]
//
//     >> ap1 [a b c] 304
//     == [a b c 1020]
//
// What makes it efficient is that the adapted function operates on the same
// function frame as what it is adapting.  It does--however--need to run a
// type check on any modified arguments before passing control to the original
// "adaptee", as failure to do so could pass bad bit patterns to natives
// and lead to crashes.
//
//    >> negbad: adapt :negate [number: to text! number]
//
//    >> negbad 1020
//    ** Error: Internal phase disallows TEXT! for its `number` argument
//
// More complete control of execution and manipulating the return result is
// possible with the ENCLOSE operation, but at a greater performance cost.
//
