// DOES in historical Rebol was simply a specialization of FUNC which assumed
// an empty spec block as a convenience.  It was thus in most other respects
// like a FUNC... e.g. it would catch throws of a RETURN signal.
//
// Ren-C experimentally pushes DOES a bit further.  Not only does it take
// blocks, but it can take any other data type that DO will accept...such as
// a FILE! or URL!:
//
//     >> d: does https://example.com/some-script.reb
//
//     >> d
//     ; Will act like `do https://example/some-script.reb`
//
// If it takes a block, it will treat it in a relativized way (as with FUNC)
// but it will not catch returns.  This means RETURN will be left bound as is.
// (Those who prefer getting RETURNs can just do `FUNC [] [...]`, this offers
// a unique alternative to that.)
//
//=//// NOTES ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// * One experimental feature was removed, to allow specialization by example.
//   For instance `c: does catch [throw <like-this>]`.  This was inspired by
//   code golf.  However, it altered the interface (to quote its argument and
//   be variadic) and it also brought in distracting complexity that is better
//   kept in the implementations of REFRAMER and POINTFREE.

//
// There are no arguments or locals to worry about in a DOES, nor does it
// heed any definitional RETURN.  This means that in many common cases we
// don't need to do anything special to a BLOCK! passed to DO...no copying
// or otherwise.  Just run it when the function gets called.
//
// Yet `does [...]` isn't *quite* like `specialize :do [source: [...]]`.  The
// difference is subtle, but important when interacting with bindings to
// fields in derived objects.  That interaction cannot currently resolve such
// bindings without a copy, so it is made on demand.
//
// (Luckily these copies are often not needed, such as when the DOES is not
// used in a method... -AND- it only needs to be made once.)
