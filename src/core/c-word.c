//
// But with limited ASCII symbols, there is strong demand for `/` to be able
// to act like division in evaluative contexts, or to be overrideable for
// other things in a way not too dissimilar from `+`.
//
// The compromise used is to make `/` be a cell whose VAL_TYPE() is REB_PATH,
// but whose CELL_KIND() is REB_WORD with the special spelling `-1-SLASH-`.
// Binding mechanics and evaluator behavior are based on this unusual name.
// But when inspected by the user, it appears to be a PATH! with 2 blanks.
//
// This duality is imperfect, as any routine with semantics like COLLECT-WORDS
// would have to specifically account for it, or just see an empty path.
// But it is intended to give some ability to configure the behavior easily.
//
// The trick which allows the `/` to be a 2-element PATH! and yet act like a
// WORD! when used in evaluative contexts requires that word's spelling to be
// available during scanning.  But scanning is what loads the %words.r symbol
// list!  Break the Catch-22 by manually interning the symbol used.
