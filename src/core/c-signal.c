// "Signal" refers to special events to process periodically during
// evaluation. Search for SET_SIGNAL to find them.
//
// (Note: Not to be confused with SIGINT and unix "signals", although on
// unix an evaluator signal can be triggered by a unix signal.)
//
// Note in signal dispatch that R3-Alpha did not have a policy articulated on
// dealing with the interrupt nature of the SIGINT signals sent by Ctrl-C:
//
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_signal
//
// Guarding against errors being longjmp'd when an evaluation is in effect
// isn't the only time these signals are processed.  Rebol's Process_Signals
// currently happens during I/O, such as printing output.  As a consequence,
// a Ctrl-C can be picked up and then triggered during an Out_Value, jumping
// the stack from there.
//
// This means a top-level trap must always be in effect, even though no eval
// is running.  This trap's job is to handle errors that happen *while
// reporting another error*, with Ctrl-C triggering a HALT being the most
// likely example if not running an evaluation (though any fail() could
// cause it)
//

//
// !!! R3-Alpha's evaluator loop had a countdown (Eval_Count) which was
// decremented on every step.  When this counter reached zero, it would call
// this routine to process any "signals"...which could be requests for
// garbage collection, network-related, Ctrl-C being hit, etc.
//
// It also would check the Eval_Signals mask to see if it was non-zero on
// every step.  If it was, then it would always call this routine--regardless
// of the Eval_Count.
//
// While a broader review of how signals would work in Ren-C is pending, it
// seems best to avoid checking two things each step.  So only the Eval_Count
// is checked, and places that set Eval_Signals set it to 1...to have the
// same effect as if it were being checked.  Then if the Eval_Signals are
// not cleared by the end of this routine, it resets the Eval_Count to 1
// rather than giving it the full EVAL_DOSE of counts until next call.
//
// Currently the ability of a signal to THROW comes from the processing of
// breakpoints.  The RESUME instruction is able to execute code with /DO,
// and that code may escape from a debug interrupt signal (like Ctrl-C).

    // due to the fact that Do_Signals_Throws can be queued to run by setting
    // the Eval_Count to 1 for a specific signal.  Review.
