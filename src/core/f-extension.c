// !!! Extensions in Ren-C are a redesign from extensions in R3-Alpha.  They
// are a work in progress (and need documentation and cleanup), but have
// been a proof-of-concept for the core idea to be able to write code that
// looks similar to Rebol natives, but can be loaded from a DLL making calls
// back into the executable...or alternately, built directly into the Rebol
// interpreter itself based on a configuration switch.
//
// See the %extensions/ directory for some current (evolving) examples.
//

#include "sys-core.h"

// Building Rebol as a library may still entail a desire to ship that library
// with built-in extensions (e.g. building libr3.js wants to have JavaScript
// natives as an extension).  So there is no meaning to "built-in extensions"
// for a library otherwise...as every client will be making their own EXE, and
// there's no way to control their build process from Rebol's build process.
//
// Hence, the generated header for boot extensions is included here--to allow
// clients to get access to those extensions through an API.

    // FFI maybe needing to make some FFI close calls.  So a better model of
    // "extension shutdown" would build on a mechanism that would work for
    // any MODULE!...registering its interest with an ACTION! that may be one
    // of its natives, or even just usermode code.

// !!! R3-Alpha's "generics" (like APPEND or TAKE) dispatched to code based on
// the first argument.  So APPEND to a BLOCK! would call the array dispatcher,
// while APPEND to a GOB! would call the gob dispatcher.  The list of legal
// datatypes that could be operated on was fixed as part of the declaration
// in %generics.r (though R3-Alpha called them "actions").
//
// Ren-C attempts to streamline the core so it can be used for more purposes,
// where suppport code for GOB! (or IMAGE!, or VECTOR!) may be redundant or
// otherwise wasteful.  These types are moved to extensions, which may be
// omitted from the build (or optionally loaded as DLLs).   That means that
// when the system is booting, it might not know what a GOB! is...and other
// extensions may wish to add types to the generic after-the-fact as well.
//
// Hence extension types are taken off the generic definitions.  The concept
// is that they would be added dynamically.  How this would be done is not
// known at this time...as an extensible generics system hasn't been made yet.
// What's done instead is the hack of just saying that all generics are
// willing to dispatch to a custom type, and it's the job of the handler to
// raise an error if it doesn't know what the generic means.  The key downside
// of this is that HELP doesn't give you information about what specific
// generics are applicable to extension types.
//
// This function is a placeholder to keep track of the unimplemented feature.
// What was done is that for all the definitions in %generics.r that took an
// extension type previously, a bit of that spec was copied into the extension
// and then passed in to the type registration routine as a block.  In theory
// this *kind* of information could be used to more strategically update the
// type specs and help to reflect the legal operations.

// functions would be done through whatever this mechanism for extending them
// with native code would be.)
