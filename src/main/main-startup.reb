    Description: {
        This is the Rebol code called by %main.c that handles things like
        loading boot extensions, doing command-line processing, and getting
        things otherwise set up for running the console.

        Because it is run early, this is before several things have been
        established.  That includes a Ctrl-C handler.  It therefore should
        not be running any user code directly.  Instead it should return a
        request of code to be handed to the console extension to be provoked
        with (see the /PROVOKE refinement of CONSOLE for more information).

; These used to be loaded by the core, but prot-tls depends on crypt, thus it
; needs to be loaded after crypt. It was not an issue when crypt was builtin.
; But when it's converted to a module, it breaks the dependency of prot-tls.
;
; Moving protocol loading from core to host fixes the problem.
;
; Should be initialized by make-host-init.r, but set a default just in case.

    Standard options:

        --do expr        Evaluate expression (quoted)
