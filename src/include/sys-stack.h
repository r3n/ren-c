// The data stack (DS_) is for pushing one individual REBVAL at a time.  The
// values can then be popped in a Last-In-First-Out way.  It is also possible
// to mark a stack position, do any number of pushes, and then ask for the
// range of values pushed since the mark to be placed into a REBARR array.
// As long as a value is on the data stack, any series it refers to will be
// protected from being garbage-collected.
//
// A notable usage of the data stack is by REDUCE and COMPOSE.  They use it
// to gather values prior to their insertion into a final array.  It's better
// for many clients to use the data stack as a common preallocated working
// space.  This way the size of the accumulated result is known, preventing
// wasting space on expansions or resizes and shuffling due to a guessed size.
//
// The data stack has many applications, and can be used by any piece of the
// system.  But there is a rule that when that piece is finished, it must
// "balance" the stack back to where it was when it was called!  There is
// a check in the main evaluator loop that the stack has been balanced to
// wherever it started by the time a function call ends.  It's not necessary
// necessary to balance the stack in the case of calling a `fail`--because
// it is restored to where it was at PUSH_TRAP_SO_FAIL_CAN_JUMP_BACK_HERE().
//
// To speed pushes and pops to the stack while also making sure that each
// push is tested to see if an expansion is needed, a trick is used.  This
// trick is to grow the stack in blocks, and always maintain that the block
// has an END marker at its point of capacity--and ensure that there are no
// end markers between the DSP and that capacity.  This way, if a push runs
// up against an END it knows to do an expansion.
//
//=// NOTES ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// * Do not store the result of a DS_PUSH() directly into a REBVAL* variable.
//   Instead, use the STKVAL(*) type, which makes sure that you don't try
//   to hold a parameter across another push or an evaluation.
//
// * The data stack is limited in size, and this means code that uses it may
//   break down when working on larger cases:
//
//   https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/issues/679
//
// * Although R3-Alpha used the data stack for pushing function arguments,
//   the arguments were frequently passed around by pointer (vs. using an
//   indexed "DSP" position).  This was bad since the data stack could
//   relocate its contents due to growth.  For this and other reasons,
//   the Rebol call stack is built out of linked REBARR allocations which
//   can be used to back FRAME! contexts.
//

// The result of DS_PUSH() and DS_TOP is not REBVAL*, but STKVAL(*).  In an
// unchecked build this is just a REBVAL*, but with DEBUG_EXTANT_STACK_POINTERS
// it becomes a checked C++ wrapper class...which keeps track of how many
// such stack values are extant.  If the number is not zero, then you will
// get an assert if you try to DS_PUSH() or DS_DROP(), as well as if you
// try to run any evaluations.
//
// NOTE: Due to the interactions of longjmp() with crossing C++ destructors,
// using this debug setting is technically undefined behavior if a fail()
// occurs while a stack value is outstanding.  However, we just assume the
// destructor is not called in this case...and the fail mechanism sets the
// outstanding count to zero.

// Rebol doesn't want to crash in the event of a stack overflow, but would
// like to gracefully trap it and return the user to the console.  While it
// is possible for Rebol to set a limit to how deeply it allows function
// calls in the interpreter to recurse, there's no *portable* way to
// catch a stack overflow in the C code of the interpreter itself.
//
// Hence, by default Rebol will use a non-standard heuristic.  A flag is
// passed to say if OS_STACK_GROWS_UP.  If so, it then extrapolates that C
// function call frames will be laid out consecutively, and the memory
// difference between a stack variable in the topmost stacks can be checked
// against some limit.
//
// This has nothing to do with guarantees in the C standard, and compilers
// can really put variables at any address they feel like:
//
// http://stackoverflow.com/a/1677482/211160
//
// Additionally, it puts the burden on every recursive or deeply nested
// routine to sprinkle calls to the C_STACK_OVERFLOWING macro somewhere
// in it.  The ideal answer is to make Rebol itself corral an interpreted
// script such that it can't cause the C code to stack overflow.  Lacking
// that ideal this technique could break, so build configurations should
// be able to turn it off if needed.
//
// In the meantime, C_STACK_OVERFLOWING is a macro which takes the
// address of some variable local to the currently executed function.
// Note that because the limit is noticed before the C stack has *actually*
// overflowed, you still have a bit of stack room to do the cleanup and
// raise an error trap.  (You need to take care of any unmanaged series
// allocations, etc).  So cleaning up that state should be doable without
// making deep function calls.
