// See %sys-frame.h for a higher-level description.
//


// The REBFRM's `varlist` field holds a ready-made varlist for a frame,
// which may be reused.  However, when a stack frame is dropped it can
// only be reused by putting it in a place that future pushes can find
// it.  This is used to link a varlist into the reusable list.

#define HAS_LINK_ReuseNext          FLAVOR_VARLIST


// !!! A REBFRM* answers that it is a node, and a cell.  This is questionable
// and should be reviewed now that many features no longer depend on it.

//=//// EVAL_FLAG_ALLOCATED_FEED //////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Some frame recursions re-use a feed that already existed, while others will
// allocate them.  This re-use allows recursions to keep index positions and
// fetched "gotten" values in sync.  The dynamic allocation means that feeds
// can be kept alive across contiuations--which wouldn't be possible if they
// were on the C stack.
//
// If a frame allocated a feed, then it has to be freed...which is done when
// the frame is dropped or aborted.

//=//// EVAL_FLAG_CACHE_NO_LOOKAHEAD //////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Without intervention, running an invisible will consume the state of the
// FEED_FLAG_NO_LOOKAHEAD.  That creates a problem for things like:
//
//     >> 1 + comment "a" comment "b" 2 * 3
//     == 7  ; you'll get 7 and not 9 if FEED_FLAG_NO_LOOKAHEAD is erased
//
// Originally invisible functions were pre-announced as purely invisible, and
// would un-set the flag while the invisible ran...then restore it to the
// previous state.  But this has changed to were it's not known until after
// a function has executed if it was invisible.
//
// The current logic is to cache the *feed* flag in this *frame* flag before
// each function runs, and then restore it in the event the execution turns
// out to be invisible.
//
// Note: This is the same flag value as FEED_FLAG_NO_LOOKAHEAD.
//
// !!! This could lead to "multiplying" the influences of the flag across
// several invisible evaluations; this should be reviewed to see if it makes
// any actual problems in practice.

// When a null is seen in f->param, the question is whether that is an
// intentional "null specialization" or if it means the argument should be

// If the frame is considered fully specialized (as with DO F) then there
// will be no further argument gathered at the callsite, nulls are as-is.

// as normal.  There's no good place to hold the memory that one is doing an
// enfix fulfillment besides a bit on the frame itself.
//
// It is also used to indicate to a ST_EVALUATOR_REEVALUATING frame whether

// side and ones that want to quote their right hand side.  The left hand side
// wins in order for things like `help default` to work.  But deciding on
// whether the left hand side should win or not if it's a PATH! is a tricky
// case, as one must evaluate the path to know if it winds up producing a
// right quoting action or not.
//
// So paths win automatically unless a special (rare) override is used.  But
// if that path doesn't end up being a right quoting operator, it's less
// confusing to give an error message informing the user to use -> vs. just
// make it appear there was no left hand side.

//
// There are advanced features that "abuse" the evaluator, e.g. by making it
// create a specialization exemplar by example from a stream of code.  These
// cases are designed to operate in isolation, and are incompatible with the
// idea of enfix operations that stay pending in the evaluation queue, e.g.
//
//     match+ parse "aab" [some "a"] else [print "what should this do?"]
//
// MATCH+ is variadic, and in one step asks to make a frame from the right
// hand side.  But it's 99% likely intent of this was to attach the ELSE to
// the MATCH and not the PARSE.  That looks inconsistent, since the user
// imagines it's the evaluator running PARSE as a parameter to MATCH (vs.
// MATCH becoming the evaluator and running it).
//
// It would be technically possible to allow ELSE to bind to the MATCH in
// this case.  It might even be technically possible to give MATCH back a
// frame for a CHAIN of actions that starts with PARSE but includes the ELSE
// (which sounds interesting but crazy, considering that's not what people
// would want here, but maybe sometimes they would).
//
// The best answer for right now is just to raise an error.

//=//// EVAL_FLAG_NO_RESIDUE //////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Sometimes a single step evaluation is done in which it would be considered
// an error if all of the arguments are not used.  This requests an error if
// the frame does not reach the end.
//
// !!! Interactions with ELIDE won't currently work with this, so evaluation
// would have to take this into account to greedily run ELIDEs if the flag
// is set.  However, it's only used in variadic apply at the moment with
// calls from the system that do not use ELIDE.  These calls may someday
// turn into rebValue(), in which case the mechanism would need rethinking.

// a specialization once.  So path dispatch can be asked to push the path
// refinements in the reverse order of their invocation.
//
// This mechanic is also used by SPECIALIZE, so that specializing refinements
// in order via a path and values via a block of code can be done in one
// step, vs needing to make an intermediate ACTION!.
