// In order to implement several "tricks", the first pointer-size slots of
// many datatypes is a `Reb_Header` structure.  Using byte-order-sensitive
// macros like FLAG_LEFT_BIT(), the layout of this header is chosen in such a
// way that not only can Rebol value pointers (REBVAL*) be distinguished from
// Rebol series pointers (REBSER*), but these can be discerned from a valid
// UTF-8 string just by looking at the first byte.  That's a safe C operation
// since reading a `char*` is not subject to "strict aliasing" requirements.
//
// On a semi-superficial level, this permits a kind of dynamic polymorphism,
// such as that used by panic():
//
//     REBVAL *value = ...;
//     panic (value);  // can tell this is a value
//
//     REBSER *series = ...;
//     panic (series)  // can tell this is a series
//
//     panic ("Ḧéllŏ");  // can tell this is UTF-8 data (not series or value)
//
// An even more compelling case is the usage through the API, so variadic
// combinations of strings and values can be intermixed, as in:
//
//     rebElide("poke", block, "1", value)
//
// Internally, the ability to discern these types helps certain structures or
// arrangements from having to find a place to store a kind of "flavor" bit
// for a stored pointer's type.  They can just check the first byte instead.
//
// For lack of a better name, the generic type covering the superclass is
// called a "Rebol Node".

    // REBARR, that's still abstract enough to block most casual misuses.

// BYTE-ORDER SENSITIVE BIT FLAGS & MASKING
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// To facilitate the tricks of the Rebol Node, these macros are purposefully
// arranging bit flags with respect to the "leftmost" and "rightmost" bytes of
// the underlying platform, when encoding them into an unsigned integer the
// size of a platform pointer:
//
//     uintptr_t flags = FLAG_LEFT_BIT(0);
//     unsigned char *ch = (unsigned char*)&flags;
//
// In the code above, the leftmost bit of the flags has been set to 1, giving
// `ch == 128` on all supported platforms.
//
// These can form *compile-time constants*, which can be singly assigned to
// a uintptr_t in one instruction.  Quantities smaller than a byte can be
// mixed in on with bytes:
//
//    uintptr_t flags
//        = FLAG_LEFT_BIT(0) | FLAG_LEFT_BIT(1) | FLAG_SECOND_BYTE(13);
//
// They can be masked or shifted out efficiently:
//
//    unsigned int left = LEFT_N_BITS(flags, 3); // == 6 (binary `110`)
//    unsigned int right = SECOND_BYTE(flags); // == 13
//
// Other tools that might be tried with this all have downsides:
//
// * bitfields arranged in a `union` with integers have no layout guarantee
// * `#pragma pack` is not standard C98 or C99...nor is any #pragma
// * `char[4]` or `char[8]` targets don't usually assign in one instruction
