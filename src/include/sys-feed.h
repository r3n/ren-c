// A "Feed" represents an abstract source of Rebol values, which only offers
// a guarantee of being able to have two sequential values in the feed as
// having valid pointers at one time.  The main pointer is the feed's value
// (feed->value), and to be able to have another pointer to the previous
// value one must request a "lookback" at the time of advancing the feed.
//
// One reason for the feed's strict nature is that it offers an interface not
// just to Rebol BLOCK!s and other arrays, but also to variadic lists such
// as C's va_list...in a system which also allows the mixure of portions of
// UTF-8 string source text.  C's va_list does not retain a memory of the
// past, so once va_arg() is called it forgets the previous value...and
// since values may also be fabricated from text it can get complicated.
//
// Another reason for the strictness is to help rein in the evaluator design
// to keep it within a certain boundary of complexity.

// Infix functions may (depending on the #tight or non-tight parameter
// acquisition modes) want to suppress further infix lookahead while getting

// `1 + 2 * 3` it didn't want infix `+` to "look ahead" past the 2 to see the
// infix `*` when gathering its argument, that was saved until the `1 + 2`
// finished its processing.

//    if 1 then [2] [3]     ; **error**
//    if (1 then [2]) [3]   ; legal, arguments weren't being gathered
//
// This flag is marked on a parent frame by the argument fulfillment the
// first time it sees a left-deferring operation like a THEN or ELSE, and is
// used to decide whether to report an error or not.
//
// (At one point, mechanics were added to make the second case not an
// error.  However, this gave the evaluator complex properties of re-entry
// that made its behavior harder to characterize.  This means that only a
// flag is needed, vs complex marking of a parameter to re-enter eval with.)

// Evaluation of arguments can wind up seeing a barrier and "consuming" it.
// This is true of a BAR!, but also GROUP!s which have no effective content:
//
//    >> 1 + (comment "vaporizes, but disrupts like a BAR! would") 2
//    ** Script Error: + is missing its value2 argument
//
// But the evaluation will advance the frame.  So if a function has more than
// one argument it has to remember that one of its arguments saw a "barrier",
// otherwise it would receive an end signal on an earlier argument yet then
// get a later argument fulfilled.

// There was significant deliberation over what the following code should do:
//
//     REBVAL *word = rebValue("'print");
//     REBVAL *type = rebValue("type of", word);
//
// If the WORD! is simply spliced into the code and run, then that will be
// an error.  It would be as if you had written:
//
//     do compose [type of (word)]
//
// It may seem to be more desirable to pretend you had fetched word from a
// variable, as if the code had been Rebol.  The illusion could be given by
// automatically splicing quotes, but doing this without being asked creates
// other negative side effects:
//
//     REBVAL *x = rebInteger(10);
//     REBVAL *y = rebInteger(20);
//     REBVAL *coordinate = rebValue("[", x, y, "]");
//
// You don't want to wind up with `['10 '20]` in that block.  So automatic
// splicing with quotes is fraught with problems.  Still it might be useful
// sometimes, so it is exposed via `rebValueQ()` and other `rebXxxQ()`.
//
// These facilities are generalized so that one may add and drop quoting from
// splices on a feed via ranges, countering any additions via rebQ() with a
// corresponding rebU().  This is kept within reason at up to 255 levels
// in a byte, and that byte is in the feed flags in the second byte (where
// it is least likely to be needed to line up with cell bits etc.)  Being in
// the flags means it can be initialized with them in one assignment if
// it does not change.
