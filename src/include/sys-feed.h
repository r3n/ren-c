// A "Feed" represents an abstract source of Rebol values, which only offers
// a guarantee of being able to have two sequential values in the feed as
// having valid pointers at one time.  The main pointer is the feed's value
// (feed->value), and to be able to have another pointer to the previous
// value one must request a "lookback" at the time of advancing the feed.
//
// One reason for the feed's strict nature is that it offers an interface not
// just to Rebol BLOCK!s and other arrays, but also to variadic lists such
// as C's va_list...in a system which also allows the mixure of portions of
// UTF-8 string source text.  C's va_list does not retain a memory of the
// past, so once va_arg() is called it forgets the previous value...and
// since values may also be fabricated from text it can get complicated.
//
// Another reason for the strictness is to help rein in the evaluator design
// to keep it within a certain boundary of complexity.
