// REBVAL is the structure/union for all Rebol values. It's designed to be
// four C pointers in size (so 16 bytes on 32-bit platforms and 32 bytes
// on 64-bit platforms).  Operation will be most efficient with those sizes,
// and there are checks on boot to ensure that `sizeof(REBVAL)` is the
// correct value for the platform.  But from a mechanical standpoint, the
// system should be *able* to work even if the size is different.
//
// Of the four 32-or-64-bit slots that each value has, the first is used for
// the value's "Header".  This includes the data type, such as REB_INTEGER,
// REB_BLOCK, REB_TEXT, etc.  Then there are flags which are for general
// purposes that could apply equally well to any type of value (including
// whether the value should have a new-line after it when molded out inside
// of a block).
//
// Obviously, an arbitrary long string won't fit into the remaining 3*32 bits,
// or even 3*64 bits!  You can fit the data for an INTEGER or DECIMAL in that
// (at least until they become arbitrary precision) but it's not enough for
// a generic BLOCK! or an ACTION! (for instance).  So the remaining bits
// often will point to one or more Rebol "nodes" (see %sys-series.h for an
// explanation of REBSER, REBARR, REBCTX, and REBMAP.)
//
// So the next part of the structure is the "Extra".  This is the size of one
// pointer, which sits immediately after the header (that's also the size of
// one pointer).  For built-in types this can carry instance data for the
// value--such as a binding, or extra bits for a fixed-point decimal.  But
// since all extension types have the same identification (REB_CUSTOM), this
// cell slot must be yielded for a pointer to the real type information.
//
// This sets things up for the "Payload"--which is the size of two pointers.
// It is broken into a separate structure at this position so that on 32-bit
// platforms, it can be aligned on a 64-bit boundary (assuming the REBVAL's
// starting pointer was aligned on a 64-bit boundary to start with).  This is
// important for 64-bit value processing on 32-bit platforms, which will
// either be slow or crash if reads of 64-bit floating points/etc. are done
// on unaligned locations.

//
// * Forward declarations are in %reb-defs.h
//
// * See %sys-rebnod.h for an explanation of FLAG_LEFT_BIT.  This file defines
//   those flags which are common to every value of every type.  Due to their
//   scarcity, they are chosen carefully.
//


#define CELL_MASK_NONE 0

// The GET_CELL_FLAG()/etc. macros splice together CELL_FLAG_ with the text
// you pass in (token pasting).  Since it does this, alias NODE_FLAG_XXX to
// CELL_FLAG_XXX so they can be used with those macros.
//
// * ARG_MARKED_CHECKED -- This uses the NODE_FLAG_MARKED bit on args in
//   action frames, and in particular specialization uses it to denote which
//   arguments in a frame are actually specialized.  This helps notice the
//   difference during an APPLY of encoded partial refinement specialization
//   encoding from just a user putting random values in a refinement slot.
//
// * OUT_MARKED_STALE -- This application of NODE_FLAG_MARKED helps show
//   when an evaluation step didn't add any new output, but it does not
//   overwrite the contents of the out cell.  This allows the evaluator to
//   leave a value in the output slot even if there is trailing invisible
//   evaluation to be done, such as in `[1 + 2 elide (print "Hi")]`, where
//   something like ALL would want to hold onto the 3 without needing to
//   cache it in some other location.  Stale out cells cannot be used as
//   left side input for enfix.
//
// **IMPORTANT**: This means that a routine being passed an arbitrary value
//   should not make assumptions about the marked bit.  It should only be
//   used in circumstances where some understanding of being "in control"
//   of the bit are in place--like processing an array a routine itself made.

//=//// CELL_FLAG_UNEVALUATED /////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Some functions wish to be sensitive to whether or not their argument came
// as a literal in source or as a product of an evaluation.  While all values
// carry the bit, it is only guaranteed to be meaningful on arguments in
// function frames...though it is valid on any result at the moment of taking
// it from Eval_Core().
//
// It is in the negative sense because the act of requesting it is uncommon,
// e.g. from the QUOTE operator.  So most Init_Blank() or other assignment
// should default to being "evaluative".
//
// !!! This concept is somewhat dodgy and experimental, but it shows promise
// in addressing problems like being able to give errors if a user writes
// something like `if [x > 2] [print "true"]` vs. `if x > 2 [print "true"]`,
// while still tolerating `item: [a b c] | if item [print "it's an item"]`. 
// That has a lot of impact for the new user experience.

// with a flag on the array itself which manages whether there should be a
// newline before the closing array delimiter: ARRAY_FLAG_NEWLINE_AT_TAIL.
//
// The bit is set initially by what the scanner detects, and then left to the
// user's control after that.
//
// !!! The native `new-line` is used set this, which has a somewhat poor
// name considering its similarity to `newline` the line feed char.
//

//=//// CELL_FLAG_CONST ///////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// A value that is CONST has read-only access to any series or data it points
// to, regardless of whether that data is in a locked series or not.  It is
// possible to get a mutable view on a const value by using MUTABLE, and a
// const view on a mutable value with CONST.

//=//// CELL_FLAG_EXPLICITLY_MUTABLE //////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// While it may seem that a mutable value would be merely one that did not
// carry CELL_FLAG_CONST, there's a need for a separate bit to indicate when
// MUTABLE has been specified explicitly.  That way, evaluative situations
// like `do mutable compose [...]` or `make object! mutable load ...` can
// realize that they should switch into a mode which doesn't enforce const
// by default--which it would ordinarily do.
//
// If this flag did not exist, then to get the feature of disabled mutability
// would require every such operation taking something like a /MUTABLE
// refinement.  This moves the flexibility onto the values themselves.
//
// While CONST can be added by the system implicitly during an evaluation,
// the MUTABLE flag should only be added by running MUTABLE.
//

// After 8 bits for node flags, 8 bits for the datatype, and 8 generic value
// bits...there's only 8 more bits left on 32-bit platforms in the header.
//
// This is used for the `HEART` byte.  The heart byte corresponds to the
// actual bit layout of the cell; it's what the GC marks a cell as.  The
// CELL_HEART() will often match the CELL_KIND(), but won't in cases where
// the KIND is REB_PATH but the HEART is REB_BLOCK...indicating that the
// path is using the underlying implementation of a block.

// But they also have leading bits `10` so they don't look like a UTF-8
// string, and don't have NODE_FLAG_CELL set to prevents writing to them.
//
// !!! One must be careful in reading and writing bits initialized via
// different structure types.  As it is, setting and testing for ends is done
// with `unsigned char*` access of a whole byte, so it is safe...but there

//
// It's important for operations that write to cells not to overwrite *all*
// the bits in the header, because some of those bits give information about
// the nature of the cell's storage and lifetime.  Similarly, if bits are
// being copied from one cell to another, those header bits must be masked
// out to avoid corrupting the information in the target cell.
//
// !!! In the future, the 64-bit build may put the integer stack level of a
// cell in the header--which would be part of the cell's masked out format.
//
// Additionally, operations that copy need to not copy any of those bits that
// are owned by the cell, plus additional bits that would be reset in the
// cell if overwritten but not copied.  For now, this is why `foo: :+` does
// not make foo an enfixed operation.
//
// Note that this will clear NODE_FLAG_FREE, so it should be checked by the
// debug build before resetting.
//
// Note also that NODE_FLAG_MARKED usage is a relatively new concept, e.g.
// to allow REMOVE-EACH to mark values in a locked series as to which should
// be removed when the enumeration is finished.  This *should* not be able
// to interfere with the GC, since userspace arrays don't use that flag with
// that meaning, but time will tell if it's a good idea to reuse the bit.

//=//// CELL's `EXTRA` FIELD DEFINITION ///////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Each value cell has a header, "extra", and payload.  Having the header come
// first is taken advantage of by the byte-order-sensitive macros to be
// differentiated from UTF-8 strings, etc. (See: Detect_Rebol_Pointer())
//
// Conceptually speaking, one might think of the "extra" as being part of
// the payload.  But it is broken out into a separate field.  This is because
// the `binding` property is written using common routines for several
// different types.  If the common routine picked just one of the payload
// forms initialize, it would "disengage" the other forms.
//
// (C permits *reading* of common leading elements from another union member,
// even if that wasn't the last union used to write it.  But all bets are off
// for other unions if you *write* a leading member through another one.
// For longwinded details: http://stackoverflow.com/a/11996970/211160 )
//
// Another aspect of breaking out the "extra" is so that on 32-bit platforms,
// the starting address of the payload is on a 64-bit alignment boundary.
// See Reb_Integer, Reb_Decimal, and Reb_Typeset for examples where the 64-bit
// quantity requires things like REBDEC to have 64-bit alignment.  At time of
// writing, this is necessary for the "C-to-Javascript" emscripten build to
// work.  It's also likely preferred by x86.

// in the C build, but the C++ build makes REBVAL a type derived from RELVAL.
//
// RELVAL exists to help quarantine the bit patterns for relative words into
// the deep-copied-body of the function they are for.  To actually look them
// up, they must be paired with a FRAME! matching the actual instance of the
// running function on the stack they correspond to.  Once made specific,
// a word may then be freely copied into any REBVAL slot.
//
// In addition to ANY-WORD!, an ANY-ARRAY! can also be relative, if it is
// part of the deep-copied function body.  The reason that arrays must be
// relative too is in case they contain relative words.  If they do, then
// recursion into them must carry forward the resolving "specifier" pointer
// to be combined with any relative words that are seen later.
