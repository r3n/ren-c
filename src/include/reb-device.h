// !!! To do I/O, R3-Alpha had the concept of "simple" devices, which would
// represent abstractions of system services (Dev_Net would abstract the
// network layer, Dev_File the filesystem, etc.)
//
// There were a fixed list of commands these devices would handle (OPEN,
// CONNECT, READ, WRITE, CLOSE, QUERY).  Further parameterization was done
// with the fields of a specialized C structure called a REBREQ.
//
// This layer was code solely used by Rebol, and needed access to data
// resident in Rebol types.  For instance: if one is to ask to read from a
// file, it makes sense to use Rebol's FILE!.  And if one is reading into an
// existing BINARY! buffer, it makes sense to give the layer the BINARY!.
// But there was an uneasy situation of saying that these REBREQ could not
// speak in Rebol types, resulting in things like picking pointers out of
// the guts of Rebol cells and invoking unknown interactions with the GC by
// putting them into a C struct.
//
// Ren-C is shifting the idea to where a REBREQ is actually a REBARR, and
// able to hold full values (for starters, a REBSER* containing binary data
// of what used to be in a REBREQ...which is actually how PORT!s held a
// REBREQ in their state previously).
