//
// Virtual Binding patches are small singular arrays which form linked lists
// of contexts.  Patches are in priority order, so that if a word is found in
// the head patch it will resolve there instead of later in the list.
//
// Rather than contain a context, each patch contains a WORD! bound to the
// context it refers to.  The word is the last word in the context at the
// time the patch was created.  This allows a virtual binding to rigorously
// capture the size of the object at the time of its creation--which means
// that a cached property indicating whether a lookup in that patch succeeded
// or not can be trusted.
//
// As an added benefit to using a WORD!, the slot where virtual bind caches
// are stored can be used to cleanly keep a link to the next patch in the
// chain.  Further, there's benefit in that the type of the word can be used
// to indicate if the virtual binding is to all words, just SET-WORD!s, or
// other similar rules.
//
// Whenever possible, one wants to create the same virtual binding chain for
// the same object (or pattern of objects).  Not only does that cut down on
// load for the GC, it also means that it's more likely that a cache lookup
// in a word can be reused.  So the LINK() field of a patch is used to make
// a list of "Variants" of a patch with a different "NextPatch".
//
// Being able to find if there are any existing variants for a context when
// all you have in hand is a context is important.  Rather than make a global
// table mapping contexts to patches, the contexts use their MISC() field
// to link a variant.
//
//=//// NOTES /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// * Sharing the MISC() field of a context with the meta information is not
//   optimal, as it means the MISC() field of *every* patch has to be given
//   up for a potential meta.  It also means that one patch becomes permanent.
//


// The virtual binding patches keep a circularly linked list of their variants
// that have distinct next pointers.  This way, they can look through that
// list before creating an equivalent chain to one that already exists.

    // * Gives more header information than storing information already
    //   available in the archetypal context.  So we can assume things like

    //   the extant cached virtual index information could not be trusted.
    //   This gives reproducible effects on when you'll get hits or misses
