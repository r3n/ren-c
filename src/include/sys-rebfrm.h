//
// The primary routine that handles DO and EVALUATE is Eval_Core().  It
// takes a single parameter which holds the running state of the evaluator.
// This state may be allocated on the C variable stack.
//
// Eval_Core() is written so that a longjmp to a failure handler above
// it can do cleanup safely even though intermediate stacks have vanished.
// This is because Push_Frame and Drop_Frame maintain an independent global
// list of the frames in effect, so that the Fail_Core() routine can unwind
// all the associated storage and structures for each frame.
//
// Ren-C can not only run the evaluator across a REBARR-style series of
// input based on index, it can also enumerate through C's `va_list`,
// providing the ability to pass pointers as REBVAL* in a variadic function
// call from the C (comma-separated arguments, as with printf()).  Future data
// sources might also include a REBVAL[] raw C array.
//
// To provide even greater flexibility, it allows the very first element's
// pointer in an evaluation to come from an arbitrary source.  It doesn't
// have to be resident in the same sequence from which ensuing values are
// pulled, allowing a free head value (such as an ACTION! REBVAL in a local
// C variable) to be evaluated in combination from another source (like a
// va_list or series representing the arguments.)  This avoids the cost and
// complexity of allocating a series to combine the values together.
//


// See Endlike_Header() for why these are chosen the way they are.  This
// means that the Reb_Frame->flags field can function as an implicit END for
// Reb_Frame->cell, as well as be distinguished from a REBVAL*, a REBSER*, or
// a UTF8 string.

// would un-set the flag while the invisible ran...then restore it to the
// previous state.  But this has changed to were it's not known until after
// a function has executed if it was invisible.
//
// The current logic is to cache the *feed* flag in this *frame* flag before
// each function runs, and then restore it in the event the execution turns
// out to be invisible.
//
// Note: This is the same flag value as FEED_FLAG_NO_LOOKAHEAD.
//
// !!! This could lead to "multiplying" the influences of the flag across
// several invisible evaluations; this should be reviewed to see if it makes
// any actual problems in practice.

// case, as one must evaluate the path to know if it winds up producing a
// right quoting action or not.
//
// So paths win automatically unless a special (rare) override is used.  But
// if that path doesn't end up being a right quoting operator, it's less
// confusing to give an error message informing the user to use -> vs. just

// There are advanced features that "abuse" the evaluator, e.g. by making it

// idea of enfix operations that stay pending in the evaluation queue, e.g.
//
//     match parse "aab" [some "a"] else [print "what should this do?"]
//
// MATCH is variadic, and in one step asks to make a frame from the right
// hand side.  But it's 99% likely intent of this was to attach the ELSE to
// the MATCH and not the PARSE.  That looks inconsistent, since the user
// imagines it's the evaluator running PARSE as a parameter to MATCH (vs.
// MATCH becoming the evaluator and running it).
//
// It would be technically possible to allow ELSE to bind to the MATCH in
// this case.  It might even be technically possible to give MATCH back a
// frame for a CHAIN of actions that starts with PARSE but includes the ELSE
// (which sounds interesting but crazy, considering that's not what people
// would want here, but maybe sometimes they would).
//
// The best answer for right now is just to raise an error.

//
// !!! Interactions with ELIDE won't currently work with this, so evaluation
// would have to take this into account to greedily run ELIDEs if the flag
// is set.  However, it's only used in variadic apply at the moment with
// calls from the system that do not use ELIDE.  These calls may someday
// turn into rebValue(), in which case the mechanism would need rethinking.
