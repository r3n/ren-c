// would un-set the flag while the invisible ran...then restore it to the
// previous state.  But this has changed to were it's not known until after
// a function has executed if it was invisible.
//
// The current logic is to cache the *feed* flag in this *frame* flag before
// each function runs, and then restore it in the event the execution turns
// out to be invisible.
//
// Note: This is the same flag value as FEED_FLAG_NO_LOOKAHEAD.
//
// !!! This could lead to "multiplying" the influences of the flag across
// several invisible evaluations; this should be reviewed to see if it makes
// any actual problems in practice.

// right quoting action or not.
//
// So paths win automatically unless a special (rare) override is used.  But
// if that path doesn't end up being a right quoting operator, it's less
// confusing to give an error message informing the user to use -> vs. just

//
// There are advanced features that "abuse" the evaluator, e.g. by making it
// create a specialization exemplar by example from a stream of code.  These
// cases are designed to operate in isolation, and are incompatible with the
// idea of enfix operations that stay pending in the evaluation queue, e.g.
//
//     match parse "aab" [some "a"] else [print "what should this do?"]
//
// MATCH is variadic, and in one step asks to make a frame from the right
// hand side.  But it's 99% likely intent of this was to attach the ELSE to
// the MATCH and not the PARSE.  That looks inconsistent, since the user
// imagines it's the evaluator running PARSE as a parameter to MATCH (vs.
// MATCH becoming the evaluator and running it).
//
// It would be technically possible to allow ELSE to bind to the MATCH in
// this case.  It might even be technically possible to give MATCH back a
// frame for a CHAIN of actions that starts with PARSE but includes the ELSE
// (which sounds interesting but crazy, considering that's not what people
// would want here, but maybe sometimes they would).
//
// The best answer for right now is just to raise an error.

// Deferred lookback operations need to know when they are dealing with an

// be `(summation 1 2 3) |> 100` and not `summation 1 2 (3 |> 100)`.  This
// also means that `add 1 <| 2` will act as an error.

//=//// EVAL_FLAG_NO_RESIDUE //////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Sometimes a single step evaluation is done in which it would be considered
// an error if all of the arguments are not used.  This requests an error if
// the frame does not reach the end.
//
// !!! Interactions with ELIDE won't currently work with this, so evaluation
// would have to take this into account to greedily run ELIDEs if the flag
// is set.  However, it's only used in variadic apply at the moment with
// calls from the system that do not use ELIDE.  These calls may someday
// turn into rebValue(), in which case the mechanism would need rethinking.
//
// !!! A userspace tool for doing this was once conceived as `||`, which
// was variadic and would only allow one evaluation step after it, after
// which it would need to reach either an END or another `||`.

// If an ACTION! is invoked through a path and uses refinements in a different

// will be necessary.  This flag is set while they are revisited, which is

//
// It is technically possible to produce a new specialized ACTION! each
// time you used a PATH!.  This is needed for `apdo: :append/dup/only` as a
// method of partial specialization, but would be costly if just invoking
// a specialization once.  So path dispatch can be asked to push the path
// refinements in the reverse order of their invocation.
//
// This mechanic is also used by SPECIALIZE, so that specializing refinements
// in order via a path and values via a block of code can be done in one
// step, vs needing to make an intermediate ACTION!.

//
// In some scenarios, the desire is to fill up the frame but not actually run
// an action.  At one point this was done with a special "dummy" action to
// dodge having to check the flag on every dispatch.  But in the scheme of
// things, checking the flag is negligible...and it's better to do it with
// a flag so that one does not lose the paramlist information one was working
// with (overwriting with a dummy action on FRM_PHASE() led to an inconsistent
