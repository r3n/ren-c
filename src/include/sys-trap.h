// Rebol is settled upon a stable and pervasive implementation baseline of
// ANSI-C (C89).  That commitment provides certain advantages.
//
// One of the *disadvantages* is that there is no safe way to do non-local
// jumps with stack unwinding (as in C++).  If you've written some code that
// performs a raw malloc and then wants to "throw" via a `longjmp()`, that
// will leak the malloc.
//
// In order to mitigate the inherent failure of trying to emulate stack
// unwinding via longjmp, the macros in this file provide an abstraction
// layer.  These allow Rebol to clean up after itself for some kinds of
// "dangling" state--such as manually memory managed series that have been
// made with Make_Series() but never passed to either Free_Unmanaged_Series()
// or Manage_Series().  This covers several potential leaks known-to-Rebol,
// but custom interception code is needed for any generalized resource
// that might be leaked in the case of a longjmp().
//
// The triggering of the longjmp() is done via "fail", and it's important
// to know the distinction between a "fail" and a "throw".  In Rebol
// terminology, a `throw` is a cooperative concept, which does *not* use
// longjmp(), and instead must cleanly pipe the thrown value up through
// the OUT pointer that each function call writes into.  The `throw` will
// climb the stack until somewhere in the backtrace, one of the calls
// chooses to intercept the thrown value instead of pass it on.
//
// By contrast, a `fail` is non-local control that interrupts the stack,
// and can only be intercepted by points up the stack that have explicitly
// registered themselves interested.  So comparing these two bits of code:
//
//     catch [if 1 < 2 [trap [print ["Foo" (throw "Throwing")]]]]
//
//     trap [if 1 < 2 [catch [print ["Foo" (fail "Failing")]]]]
//
// In the first case, the THROW is offered to each point up the chain as
// a special sort of "return value" that only natives can examine.  The
// `print` will get a chance, the `trap` will get a chance, the `if` will
// get a chance...but only CATCH will take the opportunity.
//
// In the second case, the FAIL is implemented with longjmp().  So it
// doesn't make a return value...it never reaches the return.  It offers an
// ERROR! up the stack to native functions that have called PUSH_TRAP() in
// advance--as a way of registering interest in intercepting failures.  For
// IF or CATCH or PRINT to have an opportunity, they would need to be changed
// to include a PUSH_TRAP() call.
//
//=//// NOTES /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// * Mixing C++ and C code using longjmp is a recipe for disaster.  The plan
//   is that API primitives like rebRescue() will be able to abstract the
//   mechanism for fail, but for the moment only longjmp is implemented.
//


// "Under FreeBSD 5.2.1 and Mac OS X 10.3, setjmp and longjmp save and restore
// the signal mask. Linux 2.4.22 and Solaris 9, however, do not do this.
// FreeBSD and Mac OS X provide the functions _setjmp and _longjmp, which do
// not save and restore the signal mask."
//
// "To allow either form of behavior, POSIX.1 does not specify the effect of
// setjmp and longjmp on signal masks. Instead, two new functions, sigsetjmp
// and siglongjmp, are defined by POSIX.1. These two functions should always
// be used when branching from a signal handler."
//
// Note: longjmp is able to pass a value (though only an integer on 64-bit
// platforms, and not enough to pass a pointer).  This can be used to
// dictate the value setjmp returns in the longjmp case, though the code
// does not currently use that feature.
//
// Also note: with compiler warnings on, it can tell us when values are set
// before the setjmp and then changed before a potential longjmp:
//
//     http://stackoverflow.com/q/7721854/211160
//
// Because of this longjmp/setjmp "clobbering", it's a useful warning to
// have enabled in.  One option for suppressing it would be to mark
// a parameter as 'volatile', but that is implementation-defined.
// It is best to use a new variable if you encounter such a warning.

// PUSH_TRAP is a construct which is used to catch errors that have been
// triggered by the Fail_Core() function.  This can be triggered by a usage
// of the `fail` pseudo-"keyword" in C code, and in Rebol user code by the
// REBNATIVE(fail).  To call the push, you need a `struct Reb_State` to be
// passed which it will write into--which is a black box that clients
// shouldn't inspect.
//
// Jump buffers contain a pointer-to-a-REBCTX which represents an error.
// Using the tricky mechanisms of setjmp/longjmp, there will be a first pass
// of execution where the line of code after the PUSH_TRAP will see the
// `jump->error` pointer as being `nullptr`.  If a trap occurs during code
// before the paired DROP_TRAP happens, then the C state will be magically
// teleported back to the line after the PUSH_TRAP with the error context now
// non-null and usable.
//
// Note: The implementation of this macro was chosen stylistically to
// hide the result of the setjmp call.  That's because you really can't
// put "setjmp" in arbitrary conditions like `setjmp(...) ? x : y`.  That's
// against the rules.  So although the preprocessor abuse below is a bit
// ugly, it helps establish that anyone modifying this code later not be
// able to avoid the truth of the limitation:
