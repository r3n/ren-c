// In Ren-C, any value can be "quote" escaped, any number of times.  The
// general case for adding information that it is escaped--as well as the
// amount it is escaped by--can't fit in a cell.  So a "pairing" array is used
// (a compact form with only a series tracking node, sizeof(REBVAL)*2).  This
// is the smallest size of a GC'able entity--the same size as a singular
// array, but a pairing is used so the GC picks up from a cell pointer that
// it is a pairing and be placed as a REBVAL* in the cell.
//
// The depth is the number of apostrophes, e.g. ''''X is a depth of 4.  It is
// stored in the cell payload and not pairing node, so that when you add or
// remove quote levels to the same value a new node isn't required...the cell
// just has a different count.
//
// HOWEVER... there is an efficiency trick, which uses the KIND3Q_BYTE() div 4
// as the "quote level" of a value.  Then the byte mod 4 becomes the actual
// type.  So only an actual REB_QUOTED at "apparent quote-level 0" has its own
// payload...as a last resort if the level exceeded what the type byte can
// encode.
//
// This saves on storage and GC load for small levels of quotedness, at the
// cost of making VAL_TYPE() do an extra comparison to clip all values above
// 64 to act as REB_QUOTED.  Operations like IS_WORD() are not speed affected,
// as they do not need to worry about the aliasing and can just test the byte
// against the unquoted REB_WORD value they are interested in.
//
// Binding is handled specially to mix the binding information into the
// QUOTED! cell instead of the cells that are being escaped.  This is because
// when there is a high level of quoting and the escaped cell is shared at
// a number of different places, those places may have different bindings.
// To pull this off, the escaped cell stores only *cached* binding information
// for virtual binding...leaving all primary binding in the quoted cell.
//
// Consequently, the quoting level is slipped into the virtual binding index
// location of the word.
//
