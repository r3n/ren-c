// The COMMA! is a datatype whose evaluator behavior is to act as what is
// referred to as an "expression barrier".  It will stop argument fulfillment,
// but if no argument fulfillment is in place then it has no effect.
//
//     >> 1 + 2,
//     == 3
//
//     >> 1 +, 2
//     ** Error: barrier hit during evaluation
//
// It has the property that it renders "glued" to the element to the left.
//
// (An original implementation of expression barriers used the heavier `|`
// character.  However that was considered non-negotiable as "alternate" in
// PARSE, where expression barriers would also be needed.  Also, it was a
// fairly big interruption visually...so comma was preferred.  It is still
// possible to get the same effect of an expression barrier with any user
// function, so `|` could be used for this in normal evaluation.)

    // GC from crashing on it.
