// This flag is marked on a parent frame by the argument fulfillment the
// first time it sees a left-deferring operation like a THEN or ELSE, and is
// used to decide whether to report an error or not.
//
// (At one point, mechanics were added to make the second case not an
// error.  However, this gave the evaluator complex properties of re-entry
// that made its behavior harder to characterize.  This means that only a
// flag is needed, vs complex marking of a parameter to re-enter eval with.)

//
//    >> 1 + (comment "vaporizes, but disrupts like a BAR! would") 2
//    ** Script Error: + is missing its value2 argument
//
// But the evaluation will advance the frame.  So if a function has more than
// one argument it has to remember that one of its arguments saw a "barrier",
// otherwise it would receive an end signal on an earlier argument yet then
// get a later argument fulfilled.

// acquisition modes) want to suppress further infix lookahead while getting
// a function argument.  This precedent was started in R3-Alpha, where with
// `1 + 2 * 3` it didn't want infix `+` to "look ahead" past the 2 to see the
// infix `*` when gathering its argument, that was saved until the `1 + 2`
// finished its processing.

// When processing something like enfix, the output cell of a frame is the
// place to look for the "next" value.  This setting has to be managed
// carefully in recursion, because the recursion must preserve the same
// notion of what the "out" cell is for the frame.
//
// !!! It may be better to think of this as an EVAL_FLAG, but those per-frame
// flags are running short.  Once this setting is on a feed, it has to be
// consumed or there will be an error.

// There was significant deliberation over what the following code should do:
//
//     REBVAL *word = rebValue("'print");
//     REBVAL *type = rebValue("type of", word);
//
// If the WORD! is simply spliced into the code and run, then that will be
// an error.  It would be as if you had written:
//
//     do compose [type of (word)]
//
// It may seem to be more desirable to pretend you had fetched word from a
// variable, as if the code had been Rebol.  The illusion could be given by
// automatically splicing quotes, but doing this without being asked creates
// other negative side effects:
//
//     REBVAL *x = rebInteger(10);
//     REBVAL *y = rebInteger(20);
//     REBVAL *coordinate = rebValue("[", x, y, "]");
//
// You don't want to wind up with `['10 '20]` in that block.  So automatic
// splicing with quotes is fraught with problems.  Still it might be useful
// sometimes, so it is exposed via `rebValueQ()` and other `rebXxxQ()`.
//
// These facilities are generalized so that one may add and drop quoting from
// splices on a feed via ranges, countering any additions via rebQ() with a
// corresponding rebU().  This is kept within reason at up to 255 levels
// in a byte, and that byte is in the feed flags in the second byte (where
// it is least likely to be needed to line up with cell bits etc.)  Being in
// the flags means it can be initialized with them in one assignment if
// it does not change.

// the system imposes it's own constness as part of the "wave of evaluation"
// it does.  While this wave starts out initially with frames demanding const
// marking, if it ever gets flipped, it will have to encounter an explicit
// CONST marking on a value before getting flipped back.

    // retrieves values from arrays or va_lists.  But having the caller pass
    // in the initial value gives the option of that value being out of band.
    //
    // (Hence if one has the series `[[a b c] [d e]]` it would be possible to
    // have an independent path value `append/only` and NOT insert it in the
    // series, yet get the effect of `append/only [a b c] [d e]`.  This only
    // works for one value, but is a convenient no-cost trick for apply-like
    // situations...as insertions usually have to "slide down" the values in
    // the series and may also need to perform alloc/free/copy to expand.
    // It also is helpful since in C, variadic functions must have at least
    // one non-variadic parameter...and one might want that non-variadic
    // parameter to be blended in with the variadics.)

    // Sometimes the frame can be advanced without keeping track of the
    // last cell.  And sometimes the last cell lives in an array that is
    // being held onto and read only, so its pointer is guaranteed to still

    // complicate the evaluator itself with flags and switches, each frame
    // has a holding cell which can optionally be used as the pointer that

    // be applied without corrupting the value they operate on.

    // Feeds are maintained in REBSER-sized "splice" units.  This is big

    //
    // If values are being sourced from an array, this holds the pointer to
    // that array.  By knowing the array it is possible for error and debug
    // messages to reach backwards and present more context of where the
    // error is located.

    // This holds the index of the *next* item in the array to fetch as
    // f->value for processing.  It's invalid if the frame is for a C va_list.
    //
    // This is used for relatively bound words to be looked up to become
    // specific.  Typically the specifier is extracted from the payload of the
    // ANY-ARRAY! value that provided the source.array for the call to DO.

    // be in effect at a time, and so it can't run code as it goes.
    //
    // Hence these fields aren't in use at the same time as the lookback
    // at this time; since no evaluations are being done.  They could be put
    // into a pseudotype cell there, if this situation of scanning-to-end
    // is a going to stick around.  But it is slow and smarter methods are

    // a lookback function.  But then when it runs foo, the memory location
    // where x had been found before may have moved due to expansion.
    //
    // Basically any function call invalidates ->gotten, as does obviously any
    // Fetch_Next_In_Frame (because the position changes).  So it has to be
    // nulled out fairly often, and checked for null before reuse.
