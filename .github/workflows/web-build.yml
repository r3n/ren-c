#
# GitHub Workflow for building the Wasm version of Ren-C.  It *builds* all pull
# requests to master, but only *deploys* commits that are actually merged in.
#
# Deployments will become "live" in the Web REPL demonstration directly from
# this action...but only if they are "greenlit" after running a test in a
# headless Firefox browser that is automated via Python and "Marionette".
#

# Whenever this file says "See README", that is referring to the notes in the
# %.github/workflows/README.md file.  If something appears in multiple GitHub
# Workflow files, it's best to document it there instead of repeating it:

  #====# UPLOAD STEPS #=======================================================#

    # We only want to build pull requests, we do not want to upload them to
    # the AWS server.  Deployment should happen only once a commit has been
    # accepted and pushed to master.  And then, it should only be greenlit
    # (to be the version the web console uses) if it passes the smoke test in
    # a headless browser.
    #
    # Unfortunately...there's no particularly great way to exit the steps
    # cleanly now if it's only a pull request.  We can stop the steps, but
    # it would look like an error:
    #
    # https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/662
    #
    # So either we write one giant monolithic step, or every subsequent step
    # has to be qualified with an `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'`.
    # Though the latter is not *ideal*, it's good enough for government work.
    #
    # Note: Steps will be stopped by default if any fail, but you can turn
    # a step back on with an `if: failure()` condition.


    # This action configures the AWS keys stored in GitHub's "Secrets" for
    # the repository so that `aws s3` allows us to do uploads, without needing
    # to publish any passwords publicly:

    # See README: Trusted Actions

    # Here we upload the files to AWS, but we don't bump the special file
    # that is used by %load-r3.js to decide which library commit to use yet.
    #
    # The commit ID is included in the upload because the AWS bucket holds
    # many versions of the build products at once.  To ask the web console to
    # use a specific commit ID, say:
    #
    # http://hostilefork.com/media/shared/replpad-js/?git_commit=<<shorthash>>
    #
    # The .js file contains the loading and setup code, which includes "cwrap"
    # functions that offer friendly JS function interfaces that take types
    # like JS strings, instead of being limited to the "integer heap address
    # parameters only" nature of Wasm functions.
    #
    # The .wasm file bundles both the compiled C code for the interpreter and
    # memory image (C constants, including compressed mezzanine code).
    #
    # There used to be more files, but this has streamlined over time...and
    # the pthread build is no longer supported so there's no `.worker.js`.
    # The only remaining potential build products would be debug files.  (This
    # would change if extensions are built as their own "DLL"s.)
    #
    # Note: %load-r3.js is a weak link in the test-before-greenlight strategy.
    # There's not a way to select the singular loader, so any changes must be
    # deployed before we can test any build (even a non-"greenlit" one).
    #
    # !!! The repl could be adjusted to use an alternate load-r3.js, which
    # would mean not naming it statically in the HTML.  To keep file variants
    # from accruing in the root directory, it could use some constant second
    # name (like %load-r3-preflight.js).  Review.

  #====# TESTING STEPS #======================================================#

    #
    # The ren-c-action is able to deploy a web browser and use the commit of
    # a non-greenlit hash.  It does this via a local Firefox, which it talks
    # to through Python equipped with the "Marionette" protocol.  (Ren-C can't
    # be used at time of writing, because it lacks websockets...which are
    # needed to remote-control Firefox).

  #====# GREENLIGHT STEP (MARK THE UPLOADED BUILD AS CURRENT) #===============#

    # Each ${OS_ID} directory contains several builds for recent commits.
    # Since they are served statically from S3, we don't have a query to
    # serve the most recent one that successfully built (based on a date
    # or other property).  So we write a file with a fixed name in that
    # directory to identify the last build...it can be obtained via a
    # CORS fetch() request.
    #
    # However, the upload might take a while...or fail part way through.
    # Hence, we make this the last file uploaded--so that when the browser
    # tries to fetch files for that ID, they'll all be there.
