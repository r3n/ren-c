    Description: {
        "Natives" are Rebol functions whose implementations are C code (as
        opposed to blocks of user code, such as that made with FUNC).
        
        Though their bodies are C, native specifications are Rebol blocks.
        For convenience that Rebol code is kept in the same file as the C
        definition--in a C comment block.

        Typically the declarations wind up looking like this:

        //
        //  native-name: native [
        //
        //  {Description of native would go here}
        //
        //      return: "Return description here"
        //          [integer!]
        //      argument "Argument description here"
        //          [text!]
        //      /refinement "Refinement description here"
        //  ]
        //
        REBNATIVE(native_name) {
            INCLUDE_PARAMS_OF_NATIVE_NAME;

            if (REF(refinement)) {
                 int i = VAL_INT32(argument);
                 /* etc, etc. */
            }
            return D_OUT;
        }

        (Note that the C name of the native may need to be different from the
        Rebol native; e.g. above the `-` cannot be part of a name in C, so
        it gets converted to `_`.  See TO-C-NAME for the logic of this.)

        In order for these specification blocks to be loaded along with the
        function when the interpreter is built, a step in the build has to
        scan through the files to scrape them out of the comments.  This
        file implements that step, which recursively searches %src/core for
        any `.c` files.  Similar code exists for processing "extensions",
        which also implement C functions for natives.

        Not only does the text for the spec have to be extracted, but the
        `INCLUDE_PARAMS_OF_XXX` macros are generated to give a more readable
        way of accessing the parameters than by numeric index.  See the
        REF() and ARG() macro definitions for more on this.
