=== PROCESS %a-lib.h TO PRODUCE DESCRIPTION OBJECTS FOR EACH API ===

; This leverages the prototype parser, which uses PARSE on C lexicals, and
; loads Rebol-structured data out of comments in the file.
;
; Currently only %a-lib.c is searched for RL_API entries.  This makes it
; easier to track the order of the API routines and change them sparingly
; (such as by adding new routines to the end of the list, so as not to break
; binary compatibility with code built to the old ordered interface).  The
; point of needing that stability hasn't been reached yet, but will come.
;
; !!! Having the C parser doesn't seem to buy us as much as it sounds, as
; this code has to parse out the types and parameter names.  Is there a way
; to hook it to get this information?

     * rebMalloc() offers some advantages over hosts just using malloc():
     *
     *  1. Memory can be retaken to act as a BINARY! series without another
     *     allocation, via rebRepossess().
     *
     *  2. Memory is freed automatically in the case of a failure in the
     *     frame where the rebMalloc() occured.  This is especially useful
     *     when mixing C code involving allocations with rebValue(), etc.
     *
     *  3. Memory gets counted in Rebol's knowledge of how much memory the
     *     system is using, for the purposes of triggering GC.
     *
     *  4. Out-of-memory errors on allocation automatically trigger
     *     failure vs. needing special handling by returning NULL (which may
     *     or may not be desirable, depending on what you're doing)
     *
     * Additionally, the rebAlloc(type) and rebAllocN(type, num) macros
     * automatically cast to the correct type for C++ compatibility.
     *
     * Note: There currently is no rebUnmanage() equivalent for rebMalloc()
     * data, so it must either be rebRepossess()'d or rebFree()'d before its
     * frame ends.  This limitation will be addressed in the future.
