    ; EVALUATOR
    ;
    ; Uses `#prefer-O2-optimization`.  There are several good reasons to
    ; optimize the evaluator itself even if one is doing a "size-biased"
    ; build.  It's not just about wanting the critical code to be faster--but
    ; also, since it recurses, if stack frames aren't flattened out then they
    ; add up...and may blow internal limits (like in a web browser for
    ; JS/WASM calls)
    ;
    ; !!! Note: this will not apply when the stackless branch is merged, which
    ; does not recurse the evaluator and hence avoids the problem entirely.
