    Purpose: {
        In order to limit build dependencies, Rebol makes a snapshot of a
        subset of certain libraries to include in the source distribution.
        This script will extract just the parts of ZLIB that Rebol needs
        to put into one .h file and one .c file.  It generates its
        snapshot from their official source repository:

            https://github.com/madler/zlib

        Any significant reorganization of the ZLIB codebase would require
        updating this script accordingly.  It was last tested on 1.2.11
        (released 15-Jan-2017)
    }
    Note: {
        "This runs relative to ../tools directory."

        !!! TBD: The `register` keyword has been deprecated.  If zlib doesn't
        remove it itself, then on the next import the by-hand removals will
        have to be repeated -or- this script will need to be updated to get
        rid of them (note `register` is used in comments too):
