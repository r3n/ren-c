    Purpose: {
        Ren-C "officially" supports two executables for doing a bootstrap
        build.  One is a frozen "stable" version (`8994d23`) which was
        committed circa Dec-2018:

        https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/commit/dcc4cd03796ba2a422310b535cf01d2d11e545af

        The only other executable that is guaranteed to work is the *current*
        build.  This is ensured by doing a two-step build in the continuous
        integration, where 8994d23 is used to make the first one, and then
        the build is started over using that product.

        This shim is for 8994d23, in order to bring it up to compatibility
        for any new features used in the bootstrap code that were introduced
        since it was created.  This is facilitated by Ren-C's compositional
        operations, like ADAPT, CHAIN, SPECIALIZE, and ENCLOSE.

; The snapshotted Ren-C existed right before <blank> was legal to mark an
; argument as meaning a function returns null if that argument is blank.
; See if this causes an error, and if so assume it's the old Ren-C, not a
; new one...?
;
; What this really means is that we are only catering the shim code to the
; snapshot.  (It would be possible to rig up shim code for pretty much any
; specific other version if push came to shove, but it would be work for no
; obvious reward.)

; Lambda was redefined to `->` to match Haskell/Elm vs. `=>` for JavaScript.
; It is lighter to look at, but also if the symbol `<=` is deemed to be
; "less than or equal" there's no real reason why `=>` shouldn't be "equal
; or greater".  So it's more consistent to make the out-of-the-box definition
; not try to suggest `<=` and `=>` are "arrows".
;
; !!! Due to scanner problems in the bootstrap build inherited from R3-Alpha,
; and a notion that ENFIX is applied to SET-WORD!s not ACTION!s (which was
; later overturned), remapping lambda to `->` is complicated.
;

; SET was changed to accept VOID!, use SET VAR NON VOID! (...EXPRESSION...)

; Enfixedness was conceived as not a property of an action itself, but of a
; particular relationship between a word and an action.  While this had some
; benefits, it became less and less relevant in a world of "opportunistic
; left quoting constructs":
;
; https://forum.rebol.info/t/moving-enfixedness-back-into-the-action/1156
;
; Since the old version of ENFIX didn't affect its argument, you didn't need
; to say `+: enfix copy :add`.  But for efficiency, you likely would want to
; mutate most functions directly (though this concept is being reviewed).  In
; any case, "enfixed" suggests creating a tweaked version distinct from
; mutating directly.
;
enfixed: enfix :enfix

; NULL was used for cases that were non-set variables that were unmentioned,
; which could be also thought of as typos.  This was okay because NULL access
; would cause errors through word or path access.  As NULL became more
; normalized, the idea of an "unset" variable (no value) was complemented with
; "undefined" variables (set to a VOID! value).  Older Ren-C conflated these.
