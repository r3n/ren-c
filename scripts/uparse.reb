    Title: {UPARSE: Usermode Implementation of PARSE in Ren-C}
    License: {LGPL 3.0}

    Description: {
        Rebol's PARSE is a tool for performing RegEx-style tasks using an
        English-like dialect.  It permits breaking down complex expressions
        into named subrules, and has a very freeform model for escaping into
        and back out of imperative code:

        http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore-15.html
        http://www.codeconscious.com/rebol/parse-tutorial.html
        https://www.red-lang.org/2013/11/041-introducing-parse.html

        The implementation of PARSE engines has traditionally been as
        optimized systems-level code (e.g. C or Red/System), built into the
        interpreter.  This does not offer flexibility to make any minor or
        major changes to the dialect that a user might imagine.

        This script attempts to make PARSE more "hackable", by factoring the
        implementation out so that each keyword or data behavior is handled
        by an individual `parser` function.  The parameters to this function
        are stylized so that the parse engine can compose these smaller
        parsers together as part of larger processing operations.  This
        approach is typically called "Parser Combinators":

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator

        While this overlaps with typical parser combinators, Rebol's design
        affords it a unique spin.  By building the backbone of the dialect as
        a BLOCK!, there's no SEQUENCE or ALTERNATIVE combinators.  Instead,
        blocks make sequencing implicit just by steps being ordered after one
        another.  The alternates are managed by means of `|` markers, which
        are detected by the implementation of the block combinator--and not
        combinators in their own right.

        By making the combinator list passed to UPARSE as a MAP!, is possible
        to easily create overrides or variations of the dialect.  (For
        instance, a version that is compatible with older Rebols.)  But the
        goal is to facilitate even more ambitious features.
    }

    Notes: {
        * This implementation will be *extremely* slow for the foreseeable
          future.  But since it is built on usermode facilities, any
          optimizations that are applied to it will bring systemic benefits.
          Ultimately the goal is to merge this architecture in with the
          "messier" C code...hopefully preserving enough of the hackability
          while leveraging low-level optimizations where possible.

; All combinators receive the INPUT to be processed.  They are also given an
; object representing the STATE of the parse (currently that is just the
; FRAME! of the main UPARSE call which triggered the operation, so any of the
; locals or parameters to that can be accessed, e.g. the list of /COMBINATORS)
;
; The goal of a combinator is to decide whether to match (by returning a
; new position in the series) or fail to match (by returning a NULL)
;
; Additional parameters to a combinator are fulfilled by the parse engine by
; looking at the ensuing rules in the rule block.
;
; One of the parameter types that can be given to these functions are another
; parser, to combine them (hence "parser combinator").  So you can take a
; combinator like OPT and parameterize it with SOME which is parameterized
; with "A", to get the parser `opt some "a"`.
;
; But if a parameter to a combinator is marked as quoted, then that will take
; a value from the callsite literally.
;
; A special COMBINATOR generator is used.  This saves on repetition of
; parameters and also lets the engine get its hooks into the execution of
; parsers...for instance to diagnose the furthest point the parsing reached.

    === VALUE-BEARING KEYWORDS ===

    ; Historically SKIP was used to match one item of input.  But the word
    ; wasn't a great fit, as it could be used with assignment to actually
    ; capture the value...which is the opposite of skipping.  You might call
    ; it ACCEPT or MATCH or something more in that vein, but every choice has
    ; some downsides.
    ;
    ; This is under scrutiny.  `*` was chosen in Topaz, but that means "match
    ; any number of" in RegEx and wildcarding.  So it's a poor choice.  Other
    ; candidates are ?, _, etc.

    ; Historically Rebol used COPY to mean "match across a span of rules and

    ; have assignments done inside, which extract some values and omit others.
    ; You could thus end up with `y: copy x: ...` and wind up with x and y

    ]

    === INTO KEYWORD ===

    ; Rebol2 had a INTO combinator which only took one argument: a rule to use
    ; when processing the nested input.  There was a popular proposal that
    ; INTO would take a datatype, which would help simplify a common pattern:
    ;
    ;     ahead text! into [some "a"]  ; arity-1 form
    ;     =>
    ;     into text! [some "a"]  ; arity-2 form
    ;
    ; The belief being that wanting to test the type you were going "INTO" was
    ; needed more often than not, and that at worst it would incentivize adding
    ; the type as a comment.  Neither R3-Alpha nor Red adopted this proposal
    ; (but Topaz did).
    ;
    ; UPARSE reframes this not to take just a datatype, but a "value-bearing
    ; rule".  This means you can use it with generated data that is not
    ; strictly resident in the series:
    ;
    ;     uparse "((aaaa)))" [into [between some "(" some ")"] [some "a"]]
    ;
    ; Because any value-bearing rule can be used, SYM-WORD! is also legal,
    ; which lets you break the rules up for legibility (and avoids interpreting
    ; arrays as rules themselves)
    ;

    === COLLECT AND KEEP ===

    ; The COLLECT feature was first added by Red.  However, it did not use

    ; makes the feature of limited use.
    ;
    ; This is a kind of lousy implementation that leverages a baked-in
    ; mechanism to manage collecting where the UPARSE holds the collect buffer
    ; and the block combinator is complicit.  It's just to show a first
    ; working option...but a more general architecture for designing features
    ; that want "rollback" is desired.

    ;
    ; !!! We presume that it's value-bearing, and gives back the value it

    ; The TOKEN! type is an optimized immutable form of string that will

    === BINARY! COMBINATOR ===

    ; Arbitrary matching of binary against text is a bit of a can of worms,
    ; because if we AS alias it then that would constrain the binary...which
    ; may not be desirable.  Also you could match partial characters and
    ; then not be able to set a string position.  So we don't do that.

    === GROUP! COMBINATOR ===

    ; GROUP! does not advance the input, just runs the group.
    ;
    ; This currently tests the idea that the GROUP! combinator has no result
    ; value, hence you can't use it with `keep (1 + 2)` or `x: (1 + 2)`.
    ; That helps to avoid situations where you might write:
    ;
    ;     x: [(print "testing for integer...") integer! | text!]
    ;
    ; The problem is that if GROUP! is seen as coming up with values, you
    ; wouldn't necessarily want to ignore it.
    ;
    ; !!! GET-BLOCK! acted like DO in initial Ren-C.  It's preserved here
    ; for tests, but given how short a word DO is, that doesn't take it
    ; down by much...especially not `do 'x` as `:['x]`.  Review.

    === BITSET! COMBINATOR ===

    ; There is some question here about whether a bitset used with a BINARY!
    ; can be used to match UTF-8 characters, or only bytes.  This may suggest
    ; a sort of "INTO" switch that could change the way the input is being

    === LOGIC! COMBINATOR ===

    ; Handling of LOGIC! in Ren-C replaces the idea of FAIL, because a logic
    ; #[true] is treated as "continue parsing" while #[false] is "rule did

    === INTEGER! COMBINATOR ===

    ; !!! There's currently no way for an integer to be used to represent a

    === DATATYPE! COMBINATOR ===

    ; Traditionally you could only use a datatype with ANY-ARRAY! types,
    ; but since Ren-C uses UTF-8 Everywhere it makes it practical to merge in

    ;
    ;     >> i
    ;     == 1020
    ;
    ; !!! TYPESET! is on somewhat shaky ground as "a thing", so it has to
    ; be thought about as to how `s: any-series!` or `v: any-value!` might
    ; work.  It could be that there's a generic TRANSCODE operation and
    ; then you can filter the result of that.

    ; once a rule like SOME captures a variable it won't see changes:

    ; (There is also a performance benefit, since if | was a combinator then

    ; function...rather than being able to build a small function for each
    ; step that could short circuit before the others were needed.)

    === OLD STYLE SET AND COPY COMBINATORS ===

    ; Historical Rebol's PARSE had SET and COPY keywords which would take
    ; a WORD! as their first argument, and then a rule.  This was done because
    ; the SET-WORD! was taken for capturing the parse position into a
    ; variable.  That idea was first overturned by a JavaScript implementation
    ; of Rebol called Topaz, using SET-WORD! for generic captures of data
    ; out of the parse input:
    ;
    ; https://github.com/giesse/red-topaz-parse
    ;
    ; Ren-C goes along with this change, including that the position is
    ; captured by `pos: here` instead of simply by `pos:`.  However, the
    ; concept of how combinators can produce a result to be captured is
    ; rethought.

    === OLD STYLE SET-WORD! AND GET-WORD! BEHAVIOR ===

    ; This is the handling for sets and gets that are standalone...e.g. not

    ; Ren-C rethinks this so that logic #[false] is used to indicate a match
    ; has failed, and to roll over to the next alternate (if any).  By making
