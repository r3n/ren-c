    Title: {UPARSE: Usermode Implementation of PARSE in Ren-C}
    License: {LGPL 3.0}

    Description: {
        Rebol's PARSE is a tool for performing RegEx-style tasks using an
        English-like dialect.  It permits breaking down complex expressions
        into named subrules, and has a very freeform model for escaping into
        and back out of imperative code:

        http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore-15.html
        http://www.codeconscious.com/rebol/parse-tutorial.html
        https://www.red-lang.org/2013/11/041-introducing-parse.html

        The implementation of PARSE engines has traditionally been as
        optimized systems-level code (e.g. C or Red/System), built into the
        interpreter.  This does not offer flexibility to make any minor or
        major changes to the dialect that a user might imagine.

        This script attempts to make PARSE more "hackable", by factoring the
        implementation out so that each keyword or data behavior is handled
        by an individual `parser` function.  The parameters to this function
        are stylized so that the parse engine can compose these smaller
        parsers together as part of larger processing operations.  This
        approach is typically called "Parser Combinators":

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator

        While this overlaps with typical parser combinators, Rebol's design
        affords it a unique spin.  By building the backbone of the dialect as
        a BLOCK!, there's no SEQUENCE or ALTERNATIVE combinators.  Instead,
        blocks make sequencing implicit just by steps being ordered after one
        another.  The alternates are managed by means of `|` markers, which
        are detected by the implementation of the block combinator--and `|` is
        not a combinator in its own right.  With novel operators and convenient
        ways of switching into imperative processing, it gets a unique and
        literate feel with a relatively clean appearance.

        By making the combinator list passed to UPARSE as a MAP!, is possible
        to easily create overrides or variations of the dialect.  (For
        instance, a version that is compatible with older Rebols.)  But the
        goal is to facilitate even more ambitious features.
    }

    Notes: {
        * This implementation will be *extremely* slow for the foreseeable
          future.  But since it is built on usermode facilities, any
          optimizations that are applied to it will bring systemic benefits.
          Ultimately the goal is to merge this architecture in with the
          "messier" C code...hopefully preserving enough of the hackability
          while leveraging low-level optimizations where possible.

; All combinators receive the INPUT to be processed.  They are also given an
; object representing the STATE of the parse (currently that is just the
; FRAME! of the main UPARSE call which triggered the operation, so any of the
; locals or parameters to that can be accessed, e.g. the list of /COMBINATORS)
;
; The goal of a combinator is to decide whether to match (by returning a
; new position in the series) or fail to match (by returning a NULL)
;
; Additional parameters to a combinator are fulfilled by the parse engine by
; looking at the ensuing rules in the rule block.
;
; One of the parameter types that can be given to these functions are another
; parser, to combine them (hence "parser combinator").  So you can take a
; combinator like OPT and parameterize it with SOME which is parameterized
; with "A", to get the parser `opt some "a"`.
;
; But if a parameter to a combinator is marked as quoted, then that will take
; a value from the callsite literally.
;
; A special COMBINATOR generator is used.  This saves on repetition of
; parameters and also lets the engine get its hooks into the execution of
; parsers...for instance to diagnose the furthest point the parsing reached.

    === VALUE-BEARING KEYWORDS ===

    ; Historically SKIP was used to match one item of input.  But the word

    ; it ACCEPT or MATCH or something more in that vein, but every choice has
    ; some downsides.
    ;
    ; This is under scrutiny.  `*` was chosen in Topaz, but that means "match
    ; any number of" in RegEx and wildcarding.  So it's a poor choice.  Other
    ; candidates are ?, _, etc.

    === INTO KEYWORD ===

    ; Rebol2 had a INTO combinator which only took one argument: a rule to use
    ; when processing the nested input.  There was a popular proposal that
    ; INTO would take a datatype, which would help simplify a common pattern:
    ;
    ;     ahead text! into [some "a"]  ; arity-1 form
    ;     =>
    ;     into text! [some "a"]  ; arity-2 form
    ;
    ; The belief being that wanting to test the type you were going "INTO" was
    ; needed more often than not, and that at worst it would incentivize adding
    ; the type as a comment.  Neither R3-Alpha nor Red adopted this proposal
    ; (but Topaz did).
    ;
    ; UPARSE reframes this not to take just a datatype, but a "value-bearing
    ; rule".  This means you can use it with generated data that is not
    ; strictly resident in the series:
    ;
    ;     uparse "((aaaa)))" [into [between some "(" some ")"] [some "a"]]
    ;
    ; Because any value-bearing rule can be used, SYM-WORD! is also legal,
    ; which lets you break the rules up for legibility (and avoids interpreting
    ; arrays as rules themselves)
    ;
    ;     uparse [| | any any any | | |] [

    === COLLECT AND KEEP ===

    ; The COLLECT feature was first added by Red.  However, it did not use
    ; rollback across any KEEPs that happened when a parse rule failed, which
    ; makes the feature of limited use.
    ;
    ; This is a kind of lousy implementation that leverages a baked-in
    ; mechanism to manage collecting where the UPARSE holds the collect buffer
    ; and the block combinator is complicit.  It's just to show a first
    ; working option...but a more general architecture for designing features
    ; that want "rollback" is desired.

    === GATHER AND EMIT ===

    ; With gather, the idea is to do more of a "bubble-up" type of strategy

    ; itself would switch modes.
    ;
    ; !!! A particularly interesting concept that has come up is being able
    ; to "USE" or "IMPORT" an OBJECT! so its fields are local (like a WITH).
    ; This could combine with gather, e.g.
    ;
    ;     import parse [1 "hi"] [
    ;         return gather [emit x: integer!, emit y: text!]
    ;     ]
    ;     print [x "is one and" y "is {hi}"]

    ; The idea is interesting enough that it suggests being able to EMIT with

    === SET-WORD! COMBINATOR ===

    ; The concept behind Ren-C's SET-WORD! in PARSE is that parse combinators
    ; don't just update the remainder of the parse input, but they also return
    ; values.  If these appear to the right of a set-word, then the set word

    ;
    ; !!! We presume that it's value-bearing, and gives back the value it
    ; matched against.  If you don't want it, you have to ELIDE it.  Note this

    ; and not an "OR combinator" due to semantics, because if arguments to
    ; all the steps were captured in one giant ACTION! that would mean changes
    ; to variables by a GROUP! would not be percieved by later steps...since
    ; once a rule like SOME captures a variable it won't see changes:
    ;
    ; https://forum.rebol.info/t/when-should-parse-notice-changes/1528
    ;
    ; (There is also a performance benefit, since if | was a combinator then
    ; a sequence of 100 alternates would have to build a very large OR
    ; function...rather than being able to build a small function for each
    ; step that could short circuit before the others were needed.)

    === OLD STYLE SET AND COPY COMBINATORS ===

    ; Historical Rebol's PARSE had SET and COPY keywords which would take
    ; a WORD! as their first argument, and then a rule.  This was done because
    ; the SET-WORD! was taken for capturing the parse position into a
    ; variable.  That idea was first overturned by a JavaScript implementation
    ; of Rebol called Topaz, using SET-WORD! for generic captures of data
    ; out of the parse input:
    ;
    ; https://github.com/giesse/red-topaz-parse
    ;
    ; Ren-C goes along with this change, including that the position is
    ; captured by `pos: here` instead of simply by `pos:`.  However, the
    ; concept of how combinators can produce a result to be captured is
    ; rethought.

    'copy combinator [
        {(REDBOL) Copy input series elements into a SET-WORD! or WORD!}
        return: "Redbol rules don't return results"
            [void!]
        'target [word! set-word!]
        parser [action!]
    ][
        if not [# (remainder)]: parser input [
            return null
        ]
        set target copy/part input get remainder
        return quote '~copy~
    ]

    'set combinator [
        {(REDBOL) Take single input element into a SET-WORD! or WORD!}
        return: "Redbol rules don't return results"
            [void!]
        'target [word! set-word!]
        parser [action!]
        <local> pos
    ][
        if not [# (remainder)]: parser input [
            return null
        ]

            set target null

            set target input.1  ; one unit ahead otherwise
        ]
        return quote '~set~
    ]

    === OLD STYLE SET-WORD! AND GET-WORD! BEHAVIOR ===

    ; This is the handling for sets and gets that are standalone...e.g. not
    ; otherwise quoted as arguments to combinators (like COPY X: SOME "A").
    ; These implement the historical behavior of saving the parse position
    ; into the variable or restoring it.

    set-word! combinator [
        return: "Redbol rules don't return results"
            [void!]
        value [set-word!]
    ][
        set value input
        set remainder input ; don't change position
        return quote '~mark~
    ]

    get-word! combinator [
        return: "Redbol rules don't return results"
            [void!]

        set remainder get value
        return quote '~seek~

    === OLD-STYLE INTO BEHAVIOR ===

    ; New INTO is arity-2
    ;
    ; https://forum.rebol.info/t/new-more-powerful-arity-2-into-in-uparse/1555

    'into combinator [

        if not any-series? subseries: input/1 [
            fail "Need ANY-SERIES! datatype for use with INTO in UPARSE"
        ]

        ; If the entirety of the item at the input array is matched by the
        ; supplied parser rule, then we advance past the item.
        ;
        any [
            not [# subseries]: subparser subseries
            not tail? subseries
        ] then [

            [void!]

        fail "BREAK"
    ]

    === OLD-STYLE AND SYNONYM FOR AHEAD ===

    ; AND is a confusing name for AHEAD, doesn't seem to be a lot of value
    ; in carrying that synonym forward in UPARSE.
    ;
    'and :default-combinators.('ahead)

    === OLD-STYLE FAIL INSTRUCTION ===

    ; In Ren-C, the FAIL word is taken to generally relate to raising errors.
    ; PARSE was using it to mean a forced mismatch.
    ;
    ; Ren-C rethinks this so that logic #[false] is used to indicate a match
    ; has failed, and to roll over to the next alternate (if any).  By making
    ; the logic #[true] mean "keep parsing", this allows evaluated expressions
    ; that are substituted into the parse stream via GET-GROUP! to control
    ; whether parsing continues or not.

    'fail combinator [
        {(REDBOL) Interrupt matching with failure}
        return: "Redbol rules don't return results"
