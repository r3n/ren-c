    History: {
        SHELL originated in the Ren Garden UI Experiment:
        https://youtu.be/0exDvv5WEv4?t=553
    }
    Description: {
        The premise of this dialect is to make it possible to write shell
        commands in as natural a way as possible.  This means that WORD!s
        act as their literal spellings...needing GROUP!s to run Ren-C code
        or fetch Ren-C variables:

            >> extension: "txt"
            >> shell [ls -alF *.(extension)]
            ; acts equivalent to `ls -alF *.txt`

        TEXT! strings will literally include their quotes, and GROUP!s imply
        quotation as well.  In order to "splice in" a TEXT! without putting
        it in quotes, use a GET-GROUP!

            >> command: "ls -alF"
            >> shell [(command)]
            ; acts equivalent to `"ls -alF"`

            >> command "ls -alF"
            >> shell [:(command)]
            ; acts equivalent to `ls -alF` (no quotes)

        For a literal form that does not escape with quotes, ISSUE! may be
        used.  Hence `#"foo bar"` acts the same as `:("foo bar")`.
    }
    Notes: {
        * A disadvantage of this implementation (compared to the Ren Garden
          implementation) is that each call to SHELL forgets the environment
          variable settings from the previous call.  If the CALL process could
          be held open (e.g. as a PORT!) then this could be addressed.  That
          is something that is definitely desired.
