    Description: {
        These are warnings for Rebol2 (or Red) programmers using Ren-C.
        The goal is to notice things that are likely mistakes and offer more
        guidance than just a missing word or odd behavior.
    }
    Notes: {
        Ideally, operating in "warning" mode instead of emulation mode (or
        in addition to it) would be a feature of the %redbol.reb script.
        However, parameterizing modules is not something that has been
        implemented yet.
